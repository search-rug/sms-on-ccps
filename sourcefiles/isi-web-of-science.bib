	Abstract = {{Smart manufacturing is the core in the 4th industrial revolution. Smart
   shop-floor is one of the basic units of smart manufacturing. With the
   development of the advanced technologies (e.g. cloud computing, internet
   of things, model-based definition, advanced simulation, artificial
   intelligence), a larger number of virtual shop-floors are being built.
   However, it is very important that how to realize the intelligent
   interconnection and interaction between physical shop-floors and virtual
   ones. Digital twin (DT) is one of the key technologies associated to the
   cyber-physical system. In this paper, we present our vision on the
   cyber-physical production system (CPPS) towards smart shop-floor at
   scale via DT. This paper firstly explores a product manufacturing
   digital twin (PMDT), which focuses on the production phase in smart
   shop-floor. The proposed PMDT consists of five models: Product
   Definition Model (PDM), Geometric and Shape Model (GSM), Manufacturing
   Attribute Model (MAM), Behavior and Rule Model (BRM) and Data Fusion
   Model (DFM). And then based on PMDT, this paper proposes a new
   architecture of CPPS, which is composed of five layers (physical layer,
   network layer, database layer, model layer, application layer). Finally,
   this paper addresses the opportunities to use DT for the CPPS to support
   job scheduling during normal operation. Furthermore, the related further
   work and suggestions are also discussed.}},

	Abstract = {{Internet of Things (IoT) is often envisioned as a paradigm shift from
   the traditional Internet to a scenario where all the ``things{''} will
   be connected with the Internet. IoT forced the development of novel IoT
   standards to bring heterogeneous devices and protocols under one
   umbrella for the seamless interaction between them. To this end, a
   plethora of IoT standards and definitions have been proposed over the
   last decade. However, a common consensus over these standards and
   definitions is yet to be achieved. Another contemporary issue faced by
   IoT research community is the absence of a clear functional view of
   different IoT components working together in a cohesive manner to
   achieve the envisioned ``connect everything{''} phenomena that serve the
   bigger objective of gathering the information and processing it for
   better decision making. Information gathering and processing bring the
   technologies such as ``Cloud Computing{''} and ``Big-Data{''} into the
   picture with IoT. In the line of energy efficient data processing, ``Fog
   Computing{''} was introduced a few years back that is one of the key
   enablers of the contemporary industrial revolution often termed as
   ``Industry 4.0{''}. However, there is still a need for a detailed study
   about how ``Cloud computing{''}, ``Big data{''}, and ``Fog computing{''}
   fit together and act as building blocks of the much envisioned IoT. In
   this paper, we study the aforementioned issues in the following manner.
   First, we cover almost every IoT standard and definition available in
   the literature and propose an unbiased definition of IoT that takes into
   consideration the key objectives of various research groups. We also
   discuss the key components of IoT architecture and propose a functional
   view of IoT based on Weiser's model and information value loop that
   helps to specify a clear functionality of various IoT enablers.
   Following this, a detail discussion on information gathering and
   processing in IoT is supported by state-of-the-art and contemporary
   technologies such as Cloud computing and Fog computing respectively. We
   also propose a new perspective of IoT as social processes and a
   decentralized multi-agent system in order to address not so obvious
   future challenges that may arise as the research in IoT proceeds and new
   application domains are discovered. All in all, this survey provides a
   birds-eye view for the domain as well as introduce intricacies about the
   IoT functionality, enabling technologies, challenges, future research
   trends and directions. In the end, this paper discusses the
   state-of-theart and contemporary simulations tools that can be used to
   implement the IoT based projects. All in all, this paper gives a much
   wider view of almost every technology related to IoT and its bigger
   objective of gathering more information and processing it according to
   the application requirement for better decision making.}},

   for Industry 4.0, which combine legacy industrial and control
   engineering, with emerging technology paradigms (e.g. big data,

   derive self-aware and self-configuring factories capable of delivering
   major production innovations. However, the technologies and
   architectures needed to connect and extend physical factory operations
   to the cyber world have not been fully resolved. Although cloud
   computing and service-oriented architectures demonstrate strong
   adoption, such implementations are commonly produced using information
   technology perspectives, which can overlook engineering, control and
   Industry 4.0 design concerns relating to real-time performance,
   reliability or resilience. Hence, this research compares the latency and
   reliability performance of cyber-physical interfaces implemented using
   traditional cloud computing (i.e. centralised), and emerging fog
   computing (i.e. decentralised) paradigms, to deliver real-time embedded
   machine learning engineering applications for Industry 4.0. The findings
   highlight that despite the cloud's highly scalable processing capacity,
   the fog's decentralised, localised and autonomous topology may provide
   greater consistency, reliability, privacy and security for Industry 4.0
   engineering applications, with the difference in observed maximum
   latency ranging from 67.7\%-99.4\%. In addition, communication failures
   rates highlighted differences in both consistency and reliability, with
   the fog interface successfully responding to 900,000 communication

   taking advantage from spot instances, a new service offered by cloud

   guarantees the needed fault-tolerance for the cloud environment, and
   also reduces the required amount of redundant data to provide reliable

   the storage cost and improve the resource efficiency for industrial
   applications, based on a multi-cloud infrastructure. The cost analysis
   has been carried out using both real AWS EC2 spot instance prices and,
   to complement them, prices obtained from a model based on a finite

	Abstract = {{Smart Cities combine advances in Internet of Things, Big Data, Social
   Networks, and Cloud Computing technologies with the demand for
   cyber-physical applications in areas of public interest, such as Health,
   Public Safety, and Mobility. The end goal is to leverage the use of city
   resources to improve the quality of life of its citizens. Achieving this
   goal, however, requires advanced support for the development and
   operation of applications in a complex and dynamic environment.
   Middleware platforms can provide an integrated infrastructure that
   enables solutions for smart cities by combining heterogeneous city
   devices and providing unified, high-level facilities for the development
   of applications and services. Although several smart city platforms have
   been proposed in the literature, there are still open research and
   development challenges related to their scalability, maintainability,
   interoperability, and reuse in the context of different cities, to name
   a few. Moreover, available platforms lack extensive scientific
   validation, which hinders a comparative analysis of their applicability.
   Aiming to close this gap, we propose InterSCity, a microservices-based,
   open-source, smart city platform that enables the collaborative
   development of large-scale systems, applications, and services for the
   cities of the future, contributing to turn them into truly smart
   cyber-physical environments. In this paper, we present the architecture
   of the InterSCity platform, followed by a comprehensive set of
   experiments that evaluate its scalability. The experiments were
   conducted using a smart city simulator to generate realistic workloads
   used to assess the platform in extreme conditions. The experimental
   results demonstrate that the platform can scale horizontally to handle
   the highly dynamic demands of a large smart city while maintaining low
   response times. The experiments also show the effectiveness of the
   technique used to generate synthetic workloads. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {{Cloud computing is an information technology paradigm enabling companies
   to sell computing resources more dynamically. Software and hardware are
   now commodities leased on demand. Because computer systems leased from a
   cloud service provider, virtual machines, are typically connected to
   internet, they can host web services, which are frequently components of
   service oriented architectures (SOAs). Such architectures have recently
   been adopted in factory automation, as they allow systems to reach high
   levels of decentralization and loose-coupling. SOA-based Factory
   automation systems combine physical production equipment with web
   services that belong to the information processing (cyber) domain, and
   they are therefore highly cyber-physical. When some of the services are
   deployed on cloud resources, SOA-based factory automation systems can be
   classified cloud-based cyber-physical systems. Each service in such a
   system is typically able to perform rather simple, atomic operations,
   whereas achievement of complex goals requires that the services be
   composed to collaboratively carry out workflows. This article
   investigates the use of cloud resources in automatic service workflow
   composition. To facilitate the acquisition and utilization of cloud
   resources, a system of two specialized web services is proposed. The
   system includes a web service that dynamically deploys virtual machines
   to carry out planning processes, thereby exhibiting artificial
   intelligence. Finally, this paper demonstrates the integration of the
   system with a previously proposed semantic web service composition

   platform able to cope with soilless culture needs in full recirculation

   platform at local, edge and cloud planes. At the local plane,
   Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) interact with crop devices to gather data

   accurate inference for many cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as
   autonomous cars and robots. Deep learning inference often needs to be
   performed locally on mobile and embedded devices, rather than in the
   cloud, to address concerns such as latency, power consumption, and
   limited bandwidth. However, existing approaches have focused on
   delivering ``best-effort{''} performance to resource-constrained mobile
   embedded devices, resulting in unpredictable performance under highly
   variable environments of CPS. In this paper, we propose a novel deep
   learning inference runtime, called DeepRT, that supports multiple QoS
   objectives simultaneously against unpredictable workloads. In DeepRT,
   the multiple inputs/multiple outputs (MIMO) modeling and control
   methodology is proposed as a primary tool to support multiple QoS goals

	Abstract = {{Cloud and Fog computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for the
   Internet of things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS). One
   characteristic of CPS is the reciprocal feedback loops between physical
   processes and cyber elements (computation, software and networking),
   which implies that data stream analytics is one of the core components
   of CPS. The reasons for this are: (i) it extracts the insights and the
   knowledge from the data streams generated by various sensors and other
   monitoring components embedded in the physical systems; (ii) it supports
   informed decision making; (iii) it enables feedback from the physical
   processes to the cyber counterparts; (iv) it eventually facilitates the
   integration of cyber and physical systems. There have been many
   successful applications of data streams analytics, powered by machine
   learning techniques, to CPS systems. Thus, it is necessary to have a
   survey on the particularities of the application of machine learning
   techniques to the CPS domain. In particular, we explore how machine
   learning methods should be deployed and integrated in Cloud and Fog
   architectures for better fulfilment of the requirements of mission
   criticality and time criticality arising in CPS domains. To the best of

   the basis for a modular, complex cyber-physical system that provides
   horizontal, cross-functional manufacturing process management and
   vertical control of heterogenous work cells. The modular nature allows
   the extensible cloud support enhancing its accessibility to small and

   making recent technological advancements more accessible to small and
   medium manufacturing enterprises. The project consortium includes 10
   factories to represent the typical problems encountered on the factory

	Abstract = {{During the last years, the convergence of classical automation and
   modern information technology within cyber-physical production systems
   is an ongoing process. With this development, service-oriented
   architectures and technologies of Fog/edge and Cloud computing are now
   moving into the next generations of production systems. However, these
   innovations also create new challenges in terms of complexity and
   fragility. In order to ensure reliable production operation, it is
   necessary to adapt to any disruptions and disturbances caused by
   system-internal or external events. This leads to a dynamic
   reconfiguration of both, the operational technology and the services
   including the dependent information technology. The goal of this paper
   is to provide a system- and process-independent method for the dynamic
   evaluation, embedment and placement of services on the processing IT
   resources of a cyber-physical production system during operation. For
   this purpose, both production- and IT-specific requirements and
   properties of all resource elements involved are mapped in a unified
   formal system description. This includes the individual process steps as
   part of process control, the necessary services and their dependencies
   as well as the processing IT resources such as computing nodes and
   transmission links in the field, Fog/edge and Cloud. For the evaluation
   and comparison of different combinations, a suitable multi-criteria
   evaluation metric is defined and used for resource configuration. The
   unified modeling and evaluation of process steps and services enables a
   dynamic embedment of the most suitable available services for each
   individual process step. In addition, modeling and evaluating of
   services and processing IT resources enables services to be dynamically
   placed on the most appropriate IT resources. The result is a system of
   service embedments and placements in a heterogeneous system landscape
   that adapts dynamically to production- and IT-specific events. The
   validation of the approach is based on a case study in which dynamic
   changes of a process engineering production process are examined and
   discussed. This shows how the reliability of production in dynamically
   changing system landscapes can be increased. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

   Identification (RFID) tags to track pipes and detect relevant events.
   Furthermore, the CPS has been integrated and tested in conjunction with
   Siemens' Manufacturing Execution System (MES) (Simatic IT). The
   experiments performed on the CPS show that, in the selected real-world
   scenarios, fog gateways respond faster than the tested cloud server,
   being such gateways are also able to process successfully more samples
   under high-load situations. In addition, under regular loads, fog
   gateways react between five and 481 times faster than the alternative

	Abstract = {{The evolving trends of mobility, cloud computing and collaboration have
   blurred the perimeter separating corporate networks from the wider
   world. These new tools and business models enhance productivity and
   present new opportunities for competitive advantage although they also
   introduce new risks. Currently, security is one of the most limiting
   issues for technological development in fields such as Internet of
   Things or Cyber-physical systems. This work contributes to the cyber
   security research field with a design that can incorporate advanced
   scheduling algorithms and predictive models in a parallel and
   distributed way, in order to improve intrusion detection in the current
   scenario, where increased demand for global and wireless interconnection
   has weakened approaches based on protection tasks running only on
   specific perimeter security devices. The aim of this paper is to provide
   a framework to properly distribute intrusion detection system (IDS)
   tasks, considering security requirements and variable availability of
   computing resources. To accomplish this, we propose a novel approach,
   which promotes the integration of personal and enterprise computing
   resources with externally supplied cloud services, in order to handle
   the security requirements. For example, in a business environment, there
   is a set information resources that need to be specially protected,
   including data handled and transmitted by small mobile devices. These
   devices can execute part of the IDS tasks necessary for self-protection,
   but other tasks could be derived to other more powerful systems. This
   integration must be achieved in a dynamic way: cloud resources are used
   only when necessary, minimizing utility computing costs and security
   problems posed by cloud, but preserving local resources when those are
   required for business processes or user experience. In addition to
   satisfying the main objective, the strengths and benefits of the
   proposed framework can be explored in future research. This framework
   provides the integration of different security approaches, including
   well-known and recent advances in intrusion detection as well as
   supporting techniques that increase the resilience of the system. The
   proposed framework consists of: (1) a controller component, which among
   other functions, decides the source and target hosts for each data flow;
   and (2) a switching mechanism, allowing tasks to redirect data flows as
   established by the controller scheduler. The proposed approach has been
   validated through a number of experiments. First, an experimental DIDS
   is designed by selecting and combining a number of existing IDS
   solutions. Then, a prototype implementation of the proposed framework,
   working as a proof of concept, is built. Finally, singular tests showing
   the feasibility of our approach and providing a good insight into future
   work are performed.}},

   of the proposed architecture is proved by implementing a groundwater

   using MODFLOW for the middle reach of the Heihe River Basin (HRB). The
   model is calibrated using in situ observation to ensure capability of
   simulating the groundwater process with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
   1.70 m and coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.64. The parameter

   revolution, is the integration of massively deployed smart computing and

   Specifically, I-IoT is devoted to adopting the IoT to enable the

   I-IoT and its distinct needs and to present a unified assessment of the
   technology from a systems' perspective, in this paper, we
   comprehensively survey the body of existing research on I-IoT.
   Particularly, we first present the I-IoT architecture, I-IoT
   applications (i.e., factory automation and process automation), and

   Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) allow us to develop healthcare solutions
   with more intelligent and prediction capabilities both for daily life
   (home/office) and in-hospitals. In most of IoT-based healthcare systems,
   especially at smart homes or hospitals, a bridging point (i.e., gateway)
   is needed between sensor infrastructure network and the Internet. The
   gateway at the edge of the network often just performs basic functions
   such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and
   sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and
   constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be
   transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the
   strategic position of such gateways at the edge of the network to offer
   several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local
   data processing, embedded data mining,etc., presenting thus a Smart
   e-Health Gateway. We then propose to exploit the concept of Fog
   Computing in Healthcare loT systems by forming a Geo-distributed
   intermediary layer of intelligence between sensor nodes and Cloud. By
   taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network
   and a remote healthcare center, our Fog-assisted system architecture can
   cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as
   mobility, energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A
   successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways can enable massive

	Abstract = {{Cyber-physical. systems produce large amounts of data that are stored in
   domain-related data lakes in a variety of formats. By using the big data
   technologies that enable efficient data processing, the value of the
   data increases, as these technologies can turn the data into actionable
   information that influences important decision-making processes.
   However, a broader view of the operational environment, an investigated
   phenomena, and challenges related to them can frequently be obtained
   after combining data from many data sets located in various big data
   lakes. This requires contact points in both data lakes that must be
   flexibly joined because in many cases, data sets do not correspond to
   one another directly. In this paper, we show fuzzy join operation for
   flexible combining big data lakes. The fuzzy join transforms numerical
   values of common attributes of joined data sets into fuzzy sets and uses
   such a representation in the join operation. We propose two variants of
   the join operation that transforms crisp numerical values of joining
   attributes into: 1) fuzzy numbers and 2) linguistic terms. The fuzzy
   join operation is implemented and tested in the declarative U-SQL
   language that is used for scalable and parallel querying in big data
   lakes. The ideas presented here are exemplified by a distributed
   analysis of cardiac disease data on Microsoft Azure cloud. The results
   of the conducted experiments confirm that the fuzzy join can enrich data
   sets that are used in making critical decisions and, as a highly
   scalable cloud-based solution, can be successfully used in processing
   large volumes of data delivered by cyber-physical systems.}},

   addresses these challenges by proposing a new threat intelligence scheme

   The smart data management module handles heterogeneous data sources, one

   systems. The scheme is evaluated on two well-known datasets: the CPS

   emerging IoT scenarios, in which numerous data sources, including human
   agents (i.e., Social IoT), continuously generate large amounts of data
   to be processed in a timely manner. Big data solutions could be applied
   in this respect, provided that networking issues and limitations related
   to connectivity of edge devices are properly addressed. Although edge
   devices are traditionally considered to be resource-constrained, main
   limitations refer to energy, networking, and memory capacities, whereas
   their ever-growing processing capabilities are already sufficient to be
   effectively involved in actual (big data) processing. In this context,
   the role of human agents is no longer limited to passive data

   aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications
   in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to

   Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the
   entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive
   insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions,
   and redesign business processes for game-changing business models.
   Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts

   interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists
   and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are

   food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer
   and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing

   side. The further development of data and application infrastructures

	Abstract = {{In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), efficient message dissemination
   is critical to road safety and traffic efficiency. Since many
   VANET-based schemes suffer from high transmission delay and data
   redundancy, the integrated VANET-cellular heterogeneous network has been
   proposed recently and attracted significant attention. However, most
   existing studies focus on selecting suitable gateways to deliver safety
   message from the source vehicle to a remote server, whereas rapid safety
   message dissemination from the remote server to a targeted area has not
   been well studied. In this paper, we propose a framework for rapid
   message dissemination that combines the advantages of diverse
   communication and cloud computing technologies. Specifically, we propose
   a novel Cloud-assisted Message Downlink dissemination Scheme (CMDS),
   with which the safety messages in the cloud server are first delivered
   to the suitable mobile gateways on relevant roads with the help of cloud
   computing (where gateways are buses with both cellular and VANET
   interfaces), and then being disseminated among neighboring vehicles via
   vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. To evaluate the proposed scheme,
   we mathematically analyze its performance and conduct extensive
   simulation experiments. Numerical results confirm the efficiency of CMDS
   in various urban scenarios.}},

	Abstract = {{Virtualization technology has the potential to notably advance the
   automation process in the domain of cyber-physical systems (CPS). It can
   improve both dependability and availability as well as significantly
   reduce the procurement, operation and maintenance costs of such systems.
   However, in the context of virtualization, research has put the most
   emphasis on topics of hardware utilization and fault-tolerance. There is
   little literature on how to model, integrate and consolidate a CPS by
   means of virtualization. In this paper we present a methodology for
   planning safe and efficient virtualized cyber-physical compute and
   control clusters - execution platforms for time-constrained virtual
   machines (VMs) that encapsulate CPS applications. We discuss the used
   methods, describe the corresponding models and the required system
   architecture. In contrast to typical resource allocation problems from
   other domains (e.g. cloud computing), in this case, the planning process
   must take real-time requirenients of applications into account. In order
   to achieve this, we combine evolutionary algorithms with formal system
   performance analysis - in particular algorithms considered in classical
   scheduling theory. Such an approach allows not only to optimally
   dimension the compute and control clusters, but also provides strict
   guarantees regarding the timing predictability of the integrated CPS.
   Further, the embedment of a formal performance analysis technique
   notably eases the modeling of a system. As a consequence, the modeling
   process is fast, flexible and accessible not only to experts but also to
   system designers as they do not have to struggle with complex and time
   consuming mathematical formulations. Finally, our approach also provides
   answers to several practical questions that arise when integrating a CPS
   by means of virtualization. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Internet-based systems. This reality makes cybersecurity penetration
   within the manufacturing domain a need that goes uncontested across
   researchers and practitioners. This work provides a review of the
   current status of virtualization and cloud-based services for
   manufacturing systems and of the use of Big Data analytics for planning
   and control of manufacturing operations. Building on already developed
   cloud business solutions, cloud manufacturing is expected to offer
   improved enterprise manufacturing and business decision support. Based
   on the current state-of-the-art cloud manufacturing solutions and Big
   Data applications, this work also proposes a framework for the
   development of predictive manufacturing cyber-physical systems that
   include capabilities for attaching to the Internet of Things, and
   capabilities for complex event processing and Big Data algorithmic

   in the engineering process of assembly systems. Specific meta-models are
   defined to capture domain knowledge and guide the engineer in the

	Abstract = {{Industrial systems always prefer to reduce their operational expenses.
   To support such reductions, they need solutions that are capable of
   providing stability, fault tolerance, and flexibility. One such solution
   for industrial systems is cyber physical system (CPS) integration with
   the Internet of Things (IoT) utilizing cloud computing services. These
   CPSs can be considered as smart industrial systems, with their most
   prevalent applications in smart transportation, smart grids, smart
   medical and eHealthcare systems, and many more. These industrial CPSs
   mostly utilize supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems
   to control and monitor their critical infrastructure (CI). For example,
   WebSCADA is an application used for smart medical technologies, making
   improved patient monitoring and more timely decisions possible. The
   focus of the study presented in this paper is to highlight the security
   challenges that the industrial SCADA systems face in an IoT-cloud
   environment. Classical SCADA systems are already lacking in proper
   security measures; however, with the integration of complex new
   architectures for the future Internet based on the concepts of IoT,
   cloud computing, mobile wireless sensor networks, and so on, there are
   large issues at stakes in the security and deployment of these classical
   systems. Therefore, the integration of these future Internet concepts
   needs more research effort. This paper, along with highlighting the
   security challenges of these CI's, also provides the existing best
   practices and recommendations for improving and maintaining security.
   Finally, this paper briefly describes future research directions to
   secure these critical CPSs and help the research community in

   resources and services that constitute a heterogeneous ecosystem and a
   new economic model. However, several issues remain to be addressed so
   that the Cloud becomes an efficient part of the cyber-physical system.
   In this paper, we propose to address a platform as-a-service (PaaS)
   drawback that we noted as part of our work on service-based applications
   deployment in Cloud platforms. To deal with that, we propose a new
   approach that we called SPD approach to provision appropriate platform
   resources and ensure hosting and deployment of applications based on
   Service Component Architecture or business process orchestration
   (Business Process Execution Language) specifications in Cloud platforms.
   The SPD approach stands for the three main steps of the process that we
   have defined, that is, (1) slice the application deployables into a set
   of elementary services, (2) package them into our already developed
   service micro-containers, and then (3) deploy the obtained service
   micro-containers in a target PaaS provider. Our approach is a
   PaaS-independent approach that allows developers to deploy service-based
   applications on any PaaS regardless of its capabilities. To illustrate
   our approach and to experiment its performances, we provide two
   realistic use cases scenarios, that is, a Service Component
   Architecture-based application and a Business Process Execution
   Language-based process deployment in Cloud Foundry PaaS. Copyright (C)

	Abstract = {{In order to improve convenience, efficiency, and safety in vehicular
   networking applications (VNA), we propose a novel business model based
   on platform production services (PPS), design an inter-cloud
   architecture, and then apply this emerging scheme to vehicle maintenance
   services (VMS). Both internet of things (IoT) sensing framework and
   inter-cloud computing architecture are the crucial factors in
   implementing PPS business model. In the proposed scheme, implementation
   concept, system architecture, and scalable applications are introduced.
   Then we design IoT sensing framework for VNA, including cloud services
   and computation level scalability, inter-cloud architecture supporting
   telematics applications, and telematics application scenarios. After
   dissecting mobile cloud computing forming mechanism, we carry out the
   semantic modeling analysis for inter-cloud service model, and then
   design a VMS event processing flow to allow the management and
   cooperation among diverse components by means of event manager. The
   performance evaluation exemplified by VMS is implemented by means of
   probabilistic methods. The results show that convenience and efficiency
   increase in VNA as compared to existing schemes.}},

	Abstract = {{Contemporary wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have evolved into large and
   complex systems and are one of the main technologies used in
   cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things. Extensive research on
   WSNs has led to the development of diverse solutions at all levels of
   software architecture, including protocol stacks for communications.
   This multitude of solutions is due to the limited computational power
   and restrictions on energy consumption that must be accounted for when
   designing typical WSN systems. It is therefore challenging to develop,
   test and validate even small WSN applications, and this process can
   easily consume significant resources. Simulations are inexpensive tools
   for testing, verifying and generally experimenting with new technologies
   in a repeatable fashion. Consequently, as the size of the systems to be
   tested increases, so does the need for large-scale simulations. This
   article describes a tool called Maestro for the automation of
   large-scale simulation and investigates the feasibility of using cloud
   computing facilities for such task. Using tools that are built into
   Maestro, we demonstrate a feasible approach for benchmarking cloud
   infrastructure in order to identify cloud Virtual Machine (VM) instances
   that provide an optimal balance of performance and cost for a given
   simulation.}},

   cyber-physical systems could take advantage of widely used mobile
   devices, such as smartphones, as a convenient and economical platform

   applications between humans and the surrounding physical world. This
   paper presents Vita, a novel mobile cyber-physical system for
   crowdsensing applications, which enables mobile users to perform mobile
   crowdsensing tasks in an efficient manner through mobile devices. Vita
   provides a flexible and universal architecture across mobile devices and
   cloud computing platforms by integrating the service-oriented
   architecture with resource optimization mechanism for crowd sensing,
   with extensive supports to application developers and end users. The
   customized platform of Vita enables intelligent deployments of tasks
   between humans in the physical world, and dynamic collaborations of
   services between mobile devices and cloud computing platform during
   run-time of mobile devices with service failure handling support. Our
   practical experiments show that Vita performs its tasks efficiently with
   a low computation and communication overhead on mobile devices, and
