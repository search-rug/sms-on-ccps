According to cyber-physical systems (CPS) layered architecture and security requirements in industry 4.0, a cyber-physical systems testbed based on cloud computing and software defined network (SDN), or CPSTCS is proposed. The CPSTCS uses a network testbed based on cloud computing and SDN to recreate the cyber elements of cyber-physical systems and real-world physical devices for the physical components. The CPSTCS helps assess cyberthreats against the cyber and physical dimensions of critical infrastructures.},

abstract={In cyber physical systems(CPS), the physical world and the information world are merged to form a new structure that combines both hardware and software, and become the core technology system that supports and leads the transformation of a new generation of industries. With the rapid development of network technology, the data generated has also increased rapidly, which means that today's information society has entered the era of big data, and the technology of adapting to the cloud platform has gradually matured. The cloud computing platform provides flexible and relatively inexpensive storage space and computing resources for the development of big data technology. This also provides basic support for the development of big data driven CPS based on the cloud platform. In this paper, we specify and model cloud cyber physical systems based on AADL, which can specify, model, and analyze cloud cyber physical systems, finally implement cyber physical systems on cloud platforms, provide availability analysis, reliability analysis. data quality analysis, real-time performance analysis, security analysis and resource consumption analysis.},

abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are a network of interacting physical and computer based sub-systems designed to improve the overall performance of complex systems by automatic operation, i.e., they are hierarchical, distributed (networked) control systems capable of generic “self-” properties, such as self-optimization to reduce the effects of disturbance and for adaptation to changing environment, self-configuration for manageability and resilience, etc. Currently, the target application area for CPS are autonomous vehicles, smart infrastructure like smart cities, and Industry 4.0. It is clearly visible that these application areas will be served by a large number of more or less integrated but individual applications, sharing infrastructure using a distributed architecture including networking, edge computing nodes, sensors and actuators. The trend will be similar that was observed in generic server infrastructure in the IT field. Some years ago IT services were assigned to individual server computers (mail server, WEB server) resulting in complex maintenance and low reliability. However, services run in private or public Cloud infrastructures today, where they are assigned to server machines in a dynamical and automatic way reducing maintenance while improving reliability. For the same reason, without resource sharing in the CPS applications we cannot implement them effectively due to various resource limits. For example, factory floors are overwhelmed by new devices and networks installed for various new individual applications observing and controlling production in an ever increasing detail, which applications must be also integrated in to the company IT systems for data sharing, supervision, etc. following the Industry 4.0 trend. Developers, installers and maintainers cannot keep up with the needs, and complexity grows in an intractable pace. The situation is similar to the state of the IT industry 15-20 years ago, and the question arises that we can follow the solution of the IT industry, namely, virtualization of the infrastructure for CPS.},

abstract={Cloud-based cyber-physical systems, like vehicle and intelligent transportation systems, are now attracting much more attentions. These systems usually include large-scale distributed sensor networks covering various components and producing enormous measurement data. Lots of modeling languages are put to use for describing cyber-physical systems or its aspects, bringing contribution to the development of cyber-physical systems. But most of the modeling techniques only focuse on software aspect so that they could not exactly express the whole cloud-based cyber-physical systems, which require appropriate views and tools in its design; but those tools are hard to be used under systemic or object-oriented methods. For example, the widest used modeling language, UML, could not fulfil the above design's requirements by using the foremer's standard form. This paper presents a method designing the cloud-based cyber-physical systems with AADL, by which we can analyse, model and apply those requirements on cloud platforms ensuring QoS in a relatively highly extensible way at the mean time.},

abstract={In this era of interconnectivity, where almost everybody, everything, and anything are networked, cyber-physical systems (CPS), also known as the Internet of Things (IoT), have emerged as vital systems that use information systems to observe and modify the physical world. Despite the proliferation of CPS in our lives, many such systems still use hardwired designs to accomplish a limited set of functions, such as sensing, actuating, or processing data or information. To achieve the vision of a platform for enabling the full potential of CPS that will encourage and drive innovation, CPS designers will need a new architectural design that can help connect everybody, everything, and anything together to achieve both our known and unknown goals.

abstract={New connected infotainment features and advanced driver assistance systems pose considerable challenges for the software architectures of future vehicles. As a result of the growing complexity, there are emerging needs from both suppliers and integrators for improved reuse and reconfiguration at design time. Furthermore, there is also increasing pressure from customers for an improved driving experience focusing on connected mobility and cloud technologies. This subsequently results in new challenges regarding security and adaptability, as well as reconfiguration at run time. These trends require a careful review of current automotive architectures and development methodologies. Hierarchical architectures are a widely-used and proven concept in software engineering to enable improved reuse and flexibility. In order to deal with the present issues, we argue for a novel hierarchical information architecture, which seamlessly integrates inter-car and cloud aspects at its core. In this paper, we elaborate on the research challenges and open issues of hierarchical architectures in an automotive context. We present key concepts and discuss major research topics with respect to automotive applications, but also cyber-physical systems in general.},

Compared with traditional CPS, Cloud can improve its performance, but Cloud failures occur occasionally. The existing cloud-based CPS architectures rely too much on the Cloud, ignoring the risk and problems caused by Cloud failures, thus making the reliability of CPS not guaranteed. In order to solve the risk and problems above, spare parts are involved based on the research of cloud-based CPS. An architecture of cloud-based CPS with spare parts is proposed and two solutions for spare parts are designed.

abstract={Many Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) at different scales are being developed for a variety of applications that provide valuable interactions between the cyber world and the physical systems and environments. However, the development of these systems face many challenges due to the complexity of the applications. An appropriate middleware is needed to provide infrastructural support and assist the development and operations of diverse CPS applications. This paper studies utilizing the service-oriented middleware (SOM) approach for CPS and discusses the advantages and requirements for such utilization. In addition, it proposes an SOM for CPS, called CPSWare. This middleware views all CPS components as a set of services and provides a service-based infrastructure to develop and operate CPS applications. This approach provides systemic solutions for solving many computing and networking issues in CPS. It also enables the integration of CPS with other systems such as Cloud and Fog Computing. Furthermore, as CPS can be developed for various applications at different scales, this paper provides a classification for CPS applications and discusses how CPSWare can effectively deal with the different issues in each category.},

abstract={The capabilities of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are increasingly being extended towards new composite services deployed across a range of smart sensing and controlling devices. These services enable the emergence of multiple end-to-end cyber-physical scenarios, formed dynamically based on their demands, e.g., disaster recovery systems. In such scenarios, each cyber-physical flow may be composed of a large number of physical services with composition challenges such as high dynamism of CPS platforms, rapid development and scalability, and real-time and reliable processing and controlling tasks. Cloud computing enables new perspectives in the design and operation of CPSs, including consolidating and sharing physical services among different applications, auto-scaling computing and communication, and designing and maintaining multiple in-Cloud CPSs dynamically at the same time. In this paper, we present a new architectural approach to address the key concerns of a new generation of CPS services whose functionalities reside in-Cloud (cyber), and on devices and systems (physical). In particular, this design space is focused on principles that allow in-Cloud evolution of CPS services, including dynamic in-Cloud service composition and distribution, virtualization of physical services and devices, and the dynamic creation of CPS ecosystems. In this design model, the in-Cloud cyber part may evolve independently, while the on-device cyber and physical platform still work closely together and provide the basic CPS services.},

abstract={Cyber-physical system (CPS) is a new trend in the Internet-of-Things related research works, where physical systems act as the sensors to collect real-world information and communicate them to the computation modules (i.e. cyber layer), which further analyze and notify the findings to the corresponding physical systems through a feedback loop. Contemporary researchers recommend integrating cloud technologies in the CPS cyber layer to ensure the scalability of storage, computation, and cross domain communication capabilities. Though there exist a few descriptive models of the cloud-based CPS architecture, it is important to analytically describe the key CPS properties: computation, control, and communication. In this paper, we present a digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based CPS, C2PS, where we analytically describe the key properties of the C2PS. The model helps in identifying various degrees of basic and hybrid computation-interaction modes in this paradigm. We have designed C2PS smart interaction controller using a Bayesian belief network, so that the system dynamically considers current contexts. The composition of fuzzy rule base with the Bayes network further enables the system with reconfiguration capability. We also describe analytically, how C2PS subsystem communications can generate even more complex system-of-systems. Later, we present a telematics-based prototype driving assistance application for the vehicular domain of C2PS, VCPS, to demonstrate the efficacy of the architecture reference model.},

abstract={In the future Internet of Things (IoT), smart objects will be the fundamental building blocks for the creation of cyber-physical smart pervasive systems in a great variety of application domains ranging from health-care to transportation, from logistics to smart grid and cities. The implementation of a smart objects-oriented IoT is a complex challenge as distributed, autonomous, and heterogeneous IoT components at different levels of abstractions and granularity need to cooperate among themselves, with conventional networked IT infrastructures, and also with human users. In this paper, we propose the integration of two complementary mainstream paradigms for large-scale distributed computing: Agents and Cloud.

abstract={In cloud-based cyber-physical production systems, classic automation technologies are biased by the latest developments in information technology. This leads to new challenges in terms of complexity, fragility and reliability, as a production system has much less tolerance for errors and failures than conventional systems in information technology. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of a method for the dynamic management of service resources and to propose a new, appropriate validation architecture for the described method. The method consists of an unified, formalized system description of the field, fog/edge- and cloud-based resources of a cyber-physical production system, a multi-criteria evaluation metric and two algorithmic approaches to optimize the resource configuration. The lifelike validation architecture is described in structure and workflow and is used for result verification. Different case studies can be validated with the used lab-scale test-bed. The qualitative and quantitative results show how the reliability of such systems can be increased with dynamic resource management compared to the static case.},

abstract={The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is the future of the Internet, where everything will be connected. Studies have revealed that fog/edge computing-based services will play a major role in extending the cloud by carrying out intermediary services at the edge of the network. Fog/edge computing-based IoT's (FECIoT) distributed architecture enhances service provisioning along the Cloud-to-Things continuum, thereby making it suitable for mission-critical applications. Furthermore, the proximity of fog/edge devices to where the data is produced makes it stand-out in terms of resource allocation, service delivery, and privacy. From the business perspective, FECIoT will lead to a boom and spring up of small-to-medium-sized enterprises, thereby encouraging inclusion for all. To this end, we present a comprehensive survey on state-of-the-art IoT literature over the period 2008-2018 and propose the FECIoT framework which covers the enabling technologies, services, and open research issues. A tutorial approach is employed, progressing from basic to more advanced concepts within the IoT domain. Lastly, we show how FECIoT can be deployed in real-life cyber-physical systems, such as the intelligent transportation system, smart grid, smart health-care, smart homes, and smart environment.},

Cyber-physical systems, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and Cloud computing, play a key role in the fourth industrial revolution known as Industry 4.0. The microservice architecture has evolved as an alternative to SOA and promises to address many of the challenges in software development. In this paper, we adopt the concept of microservice and describe a framework for manufacturing systems that has the cyber-physical microservice as the key construct. The manufacturing plant processes are defined as compositions of primitive cyber-physical microservices adopting either the orchestration or the choreography pattern. IoT technologies are used for system integration and model-driven engineering is utilized to semi-automate the development process for the industrial engineer, who is not familiar with microservices and IoT.

abstract={Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) can be one of the cost-effective options of modern intelligent transportation systems in smart grid (SG) which can balance the demand and supply by temporarily storing the electrical energy in their batteries. In this paper, we propose a new context-aware layered architecture for demand side management using vehicular cyber-physical system (VCPS) with cloud support. We have used the concept of Bayesian coalition game and learning automata for an intelligent context-aware data collection and processing using a new payoff function for the players in the coalition game. In the proposed scheme, vehicles are assumed as the players which sense the SG environment during their mobility and collect information from it. The players in the game perform actions such as alert generation, and information dissemination. For each action, players receive a feedback from the environment according to which they update their action probability vector. The performance of the proposed scheme shows that there is a reduction in energy shortage by 30%, and information processing delay of 10%-15%. In addition, there is an increase of 15% in energy sold back to the grid using the proposed scheme. The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

abstract={The pillars of Industry 4.0 require a modern smart factory to be integrated, store data into the Cloud, access the Cloud for data analytics and share information at software level for simulation and Hardware-In-the-Loop capabilities. The resulting Cyber-Physical System is often called Cyber-Physical Manufacturing System, and it becomes fundamental to cope with the increased system complexity and the desired performances. However, since a lot of old production systems are based on monolitic architectures, with limited external communication ports and reduced local computational capabilities, it is very difficult to make such production lines compliant to Industry 4.0 pillars. Wireless Sensor Network is a solution for the smart connection of a production line to a Cyber-Physical System architecture, data processing through Cloud Computing. The scope of this research work is to propose an intermediate layer within the architecture that allows each device, production line and machine to be independently connected despite the adopted protocol. The solution is based on OSGi Framework, which is able to seamlessly integrate both hardware and software wireless sensors, send data into the Cloud for further data analysis, and grant both Hardware-In-the-Loop and Cloud Computing capabilities. A general description of the architecture is here proposed, together with preliminary results on a real manufacturing line for data collection and analysis over a period of two months.},

abstract={Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are convergence of real physical world and computation world. CPS systems are rapidly becoming an important development strategies with broad application domains. The key requirements for CPS systems are to support multiple applications with many different resources at the same time in timeliness and also ensure energy efficiency. This paper presents the Cyber-Physical integrated cloud computing system called Cyber-Physical Cloud (CPC) to solve these key requirements. CPC architecture is designed for various applications such as health care, smart cars, traffic control, etc where multiple wireless sensor networks (WSNs) communicate with each other through mobile ad hoc network. Concurrently, CPC architecture can leverage cloud computing to process effectively computation and resource management by virtualization technique. Moreover, CPS systems are built on heterogeneous WSNs to collect and process the physical objects by obtaining data and thereafter processing queries. As a part of CPS systems, the key requirement for WSNs is to sustain a long lifetime because of limited power supplies. We work on real time preemptive query scheduling in WSNs with a focus on quality of data (QoD) to analysis useful energy consumption and interference energy consumption. We propose the Energy efficiency Aware Quality of Data (EAQD) method that runs on real time preemptive query scheduling to find the expected QoD for each query thus enabling energy consumption minimization. EAQD method also computes the transmitting/receiving slots needed for each query to avoid wasting slots. The simulation results show the our approach can reduce energy consumption up to 5 times as compares to previous approaches.},

abstract={A global Internet of Things demands new cloud architectures that can scale to support all kind of loosely coupled data and events producers and consumers. Moreover, these architectures need to be capable of offering low-latency delivery, which must not only feed real-time analytics applications, but also produce real-time actionable data that could enable operational business logic and automation triggers activation and transform microservices into cyber-physical microapplications. The design principles to build distributed event-driven applications are known to be complex and hard to handle at the application code level. As a result, there are several already well-known patterns that aim to provide a convenient solution and abstract the business logic development from the underlying architecture complexities. This paper proposes a common framework that addresses all the needs of an in-production application, that are hard to solve under the event-driven paradigm. It gathers existing patterns and combines them and extends them. These patterns are implemented and comprised in a middleware library which has been tested on a proof-of-concept architecture implementation, based on Apache Kafka.},

abstract={With the number of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) in the North American power grid scaling up into the thousands, system operators are gradually inclining towards distributed cyber-physical architectures for executing wide-area monitoring and control operations using Synchrophasors. Traditional centralized approaches, in fact, are anticipated to become untenable soon due to various factors such as data volume, security against single point of failure, communication overhead, and failure to adhere to real-time deadlines. In this talk I will propose a distributed communication and computational architecture, and its associated distributed optimal control algorithms, for one of the most critical applications run by utility companies - namely, wide-area control of power flow oscillations following small-signal and large-signal disturbances in the grid. In this architecture, Synchrophasor data from PMUs located at the terminal buses of generators are first transmitted to the local control center for that particular balancing region, and thereafter to a set virtual computers in a local cloud computing network. Depending on the correlation between the generator states in terms of the modal content of the measured signals, a distributed communication strategy is chosen and established between these virtual computers in the cloud. A real-time model-predictive control design is then implemented using this distributed communication network, assuming synchronous communication. I will present simulations that highlight some interesting convergence and accuracy trade-offs for the real-time implementation of the wide-area controller, and also illustrate their architectural resiliency against denial-of-service and data-manipulation attacks using case studies from the recently federated DETER-WAMS testbed between NC State and University of Southern California.},

abstract={The rapid development of information & communication technology has led to the wide popularity of mobile devices, which have helped to improve business efficiency and enabled simple mobility as small and light devices and convenience of being available anytime, anywhere for cyber-physical-social big data. There are many ongoing studies on mobile cloud computing (MCC) to overcome the limited computing capability and storage capacity and internal battery limitation by taking advantage of the popularity of mobile devices for the processing cyber-physicalsocial big data. MCC consists of service-oriented architecture, agent-client architecture, and collaborative architecture, with job splitting and allocation as the critical factor. As such, job allocation techniques considering the performance resources of mobile devices have been studied. Note, however, that there is a problem of job reallocation due to continuous battery consumption, since the studies consider only the performance resources of mobile devices at the time of job allocation or take into account the performance resources and remaining battery power only. This paper proposes the job allocation mechanism (JAM) for battery consumption minimization of cyber-physical-social big data processing in MCC, which continuously reflects the battery consumption rate to process jobs with mobile devices only without an external cloud server in a collaborative architecture-based MCC environment. JAM allocates jobs considering the periodic measurement of battery consumption and surplus resource to minimize the problem of job reallocation due to battery rundown of the mobile devices. This paper designs and implements a system for verifying JAM and demonstrated that the job processing speed increased in an MCC environment for cyber-physical-social big data.},

abstract={Cyber-manufacturing systems (CMS) interconnect manufacturing facilities via sensing and actuation networks to provide reliable computation and communication services in smart manufacturing. In CMS, various advanced data analytics have been proposed to support effective decision-making. However, most of them were formulated in a centralized manner to be executed on single workstations, or on Cloud computation units as the data size dramatically increases. Therefore, the computation or communication service may not be responsive to support online decision-making in CMS. In this research, a method to decompose a group of existing advanced data analytics models (i.e., family learning for CMS modeling) into their distributed variants is proposed via alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM). It improves the computation services in a Fog-Cloud computation network. A simulation study is conducted to validate the advantages of the proposed distributed method on Fog-Cloud computation network over Cloud computation system. Besides, six performance evaluation metrics are adopted from the literature to access the performance of computation and communication. The evaluation results also indicate the relationship between Fog-Cloud architectures and computation performances, which can contribute to the efficient design of Fog-Cloud architectures in the future.},

abstract={A network of vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPSs) can use wireless communications to interact with each other and the surrounding environment to improve transportation safety, mobility, and sustainability. However, cloud-oriented architectures are vulnerable to cyber attacks, which may endanger passenger and pedestrian safety and privacy, and cause severe property damage. For instance, a hacker can use message falsification attack to affect functionality of a particular application in a platoon of VCPSs. In this paper, a neural network-based fault detection technique is applied to detect and track fault data injection attacks on the cooperative adaptive cruise control layer of a platoon of connected vehicles in real time. A decision support system was developed to reduce the probability and severity of any consequent accident. A case study with its design specifications is demonstrated in detail. The simulation results show that the proposed method can improve system reliability, robustness, and safety.},

abstract={With the development of communication and control technology, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have received increasing attention from both industry and academia. However, plenty of studies providing different formulations for ITS depend on Master Control Center and require a high level of hardware configuration. The systematized technologies for distributed architectures are still not explored in detail. In this paper, we proposed a novel distributed cyber-physical system for connected and automated vehicles, and related methodologies are illustrated. Every vehicle in this system is modeled as a double-integrator and supposed to travel along a desired trajectory for maintaining a rigid formation geometry. The desired trajectory is generated by reference leading vehicles using information from multiple sources, while ordinary following vehicles use velocity and position information from their nearest neighbors and sensor information from on-board sensors to correct their own performance. Information graphs are used to illustrate the interaction topology between connected and automated vehicles. Edge computing technology is used to analyze and process information, such that the risk of privacy leaks can be greatly reduced. The performance scaling laws for the network with a one-dimensional information graph are generalized to networks with D-dimensional information graphs, and the results of the experiments show that the performance of the connected and automated vehicles matches very well with analytic predictions. Some design guidelines and open questions are provided for the future study.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems increasingly rely on distributed computing platforms where sensing, computing, actuation, and communication resources are shared by a multitude of applications. Such 'cyber-physical cloud computing platforms' present novel challenges because the system is built from mobile embedded devices, is inherently distributed, and typically suffers from highly fluctuating connectivity among the modules. Architecting software for these systems raises many challenges not present in traditional cloud computing. Effective management of constrained resources and application isolation without adversely affecting performance are necessary. Autonomous fault management and real-time performance requirements must be met in a verifiable manner. It is also both critical and challenging to support multiple end-users whose diverse software applications have changing demands for computational and communication resources, while operating on different levels and in separate domains of security. The solution presented in this paper is based on a layered architecture consisting of a novel operating system, a middleware layer, and component-structured applications. The component model facilitates the construction of software applications from modular and reusable components that are deployed in the distributed system and interact only through well-defined mechanisms. The complexity of creating applications and performing system integration is mitigated through the use of a domain-specific model-driven development process that relies on a domain-specific modeling language and its accompanying graphical modeling tools, software generators for synthesizing infrastructure code, and the extensive use of model-based analysis for verification and validation.},

abstract={The emergence of Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things (IoT) has meant that the manufacturing industry has evolved from embedded systems to cyber-physical systems (CPSs). This transformation has provided manufacturers with the ability to measure the performance of industrial equipment by means of data gathered from on-board sensors. This allows the status of industrial systems to be monitored and can detect anomalies. However, the increased amount of measured data has prompted many companies to investigate innovative ways to manage these volumes of data. In recent years, cloud computing and big data technologies have emerged among the scientific communities as key enabling technologies to address the current needs of CPSs. This paper presents a large-scale platform for CPS real-time monitoring based on big data technologies, which aims to perform real-time analysis that targets the monitoring of industrial machines in a real work environment. This paper is validated by implementing the proposed solution on a real industrial use case that includes several industrial press machines. The formal experiments in a real scenario are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of this solution and also its adequacy and scalability for future demand requirements. As a result of the implantation of this solution, the overall equipment effectiveness has been improved.},

abstract={A cyber-physical system primarily defines the interaction of the physical world with a system built with components drawn from the computational, communication and control system domains. Existing security measures either target the sensor hardware or the control system software component to counter cyber attacks. In addition, the current set of security requirements are inadequate when transitioning from legacy electro-mechanical control systems to current smart large scale industrial Internet-of-Things (IoT) control systems. This paper focuses on the architectural enhancements for distributing the root-of-trust between both hardware and software components. This distribution of trust makes it difficult for a hardware-only or software-only attack to cripple the system. The proposed approach is applied to a motor control algorithm widely used in industrial IoT systems, consisting of third-party soft IP cores, where an attack on such a system can cripple it. The resulting implementation is evaluated by subjecting the system to multiple hardware Trojan attacks. In all the cases, the proposed approach proves to be resilient to the cyber attacks.},

The application of fog computing enhances autonomy and collaboration of CNC machine tools. It also reduces network traffic and calculation workload of the cloud platform in the FC-CPMTS. To demonstrate the rationality and feasibility of the FC-CPMTS, an FC-CPMTS for a heavy-duty CNC machine tool is taken as a case study.

abstract={Industrial systems always prefer to reduce their operational expenses. To support such reductions, they need solutions that are capable of providing stability, fault tolerance, and flexibility. One such solution for industrial systems is cyber physical system (CPS) integration with the Internet of Things (IoT) utilizing cloud computing services. These CPSs can be considered as smart industrial systems, with their most prevalent applications in smart transportation, smart grids, smart medical and eHealthcare systems, and many more. These industrial CPSs mostly utilize supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems to control and monitor their critical infrastructure (CI). For example, WebSCADA is an application used for smart medical technologies, making improved patient monitoring and more timely decisions possible. The focus of the study presented in this paper is to highlight the security challenges that the industrial SCADA systems face in an IoT-cloud environment. Classical SCADA systems are already lacking in proper security measures; however, with the integration of complex new architectures for the future Internet based on the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, mobile wireless sensor networks, and so on, there are large issues at stakes in the security and deployment of these classical systems. Therefore, the integration of these future Internet concepts needs more research effort. This paper, along with highlighting the security challenges of these CI's, also provides the existing best practices and recommendations for improving and maintaining security. Finally, this paper briefly describes future research directions to secure these critical CPSs and help the research community in identifying the research gaps in this regard.},

abstract={Cloud-integrated cyber-physical system (CCPS) is playing an increasingly important role in our daily life. Unfortunately, how to dynamically make the reserved bandwidth allocation for CCPS is still a great challenge. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy that systematically and dynamically allocates reserved bandwidth for multiple CPS services in CCPS with a nearly optimal method. By making a balance between the three key factors of crash cost, QoS loss and operating cost, the proposed strategy is able to minimize the operating cost, the influence of the discrepancy between the service-level agreement and the bandwidth actually delivered, while preserving essential QoS level. Then we develop an online algorithm based on the proposed strategy using the Lyapunov optimization theory. The online algorithm can approximate the optimal solution within provable bounds and is capable of processing the tasks within a preset delay. Theoretical analysis of performance proves advantages and shows that the algorithm has the ability to solve the complicated dynamic bandwidth allocation problems for multiple CPS services in practical CCPS. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness as well as its superiority to five existing strategies (FM, MS + LB, MS + EF, DS + LB, DS + EF) in overall cost, crash cost, QoS loss, and operating cost.},

abstract={In the cyber-physic power system (CPPS) scenario, an increasing number of new devices, such as large-scale electric meters, embedded controllers and powerful computing devices are introduced into the power system. However, the architecture of present power system limits the seamless integration of the information system and physical systems. In this paper, a decentralized CPPS-fog architecture is proposed to address this issue. The proposed architecture distributes computing, communication storage, and control these services to the edge network along the cloud-to-thing continuum while the latter is commonly used in the smart grid. By applying the new architecture to the power system, the intelligence resources of the power system are effectively allocated to the parts closer to end users. Moreover, the realtime monitoring, on-line simulation, information integration, large-scale distributed control, and information security protection are easily achieved. The feasibility and advantages of the CPPS-fog architecture are demonstrated by the application in an island micro CPPS grid project.},

abstract={The connectivity of industrial automation domain systems has been enhanced by the employment of information and communication technologies. This permits the implementation of systems that are aligned with the vision of the fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0. In this scope, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), i.e., integration of cyber and physical systems, enables the control and monitoring of modern production lines. Previous research work has proposed the implementation of a Private Local Automation Cloud (PLAC) that is composed by a set of networked embedded devices that are connected to industrial equipment. Such devices implement the service oriented architecture paradigm within the encapsulation of a knowledge model that describe the industrial system and the web service operations to be physically executed at the factory shop floor level. Aspects of such approach as the collaborative behavior of devices, decentralization of system knowledge or the interface between industrial equipment and devices have been already proved. However, a common architecture for implementing similar solutions is still missing. This paper aims to present an architecture for implementing PLACs which are built by CPS. In order to provide a formal design, the architecture is shown and discussed through a set of different and concurrent views following the known “4+1” view model. In addition, the manuscript reviews relevant qualitative attributes of several CPS-based architectures, research works and solutions that have been published during the last years.},

abstract={Cyber-physical system (CPS) emphasizes dynamic collaboration of physical process and computation process. Its high demands for real-time, safety, security, and reliability require deep integration of control, computation and communication. To achieve better performance and resource utilization in CPS, we propose a framework named cloud based cyber-physical system (CCPS) which strengthens cooperation among various layers in CPS.CCPS adopts closed-loop control, and makes use of cloud service for data processing in cyber-physical cloud (CPC). In order to balance real-time performance and cost of cloud service, network scheduling algorithms in various cloud models are widely discussed in this paper. In addition, we have a broad discussion on effection of tasks scheduling with respect to stability of controller in CCPS in view of time delay. Accordingly, we give simulation and comparison results of the proposed scheduling algorithms for illustration.},

abstract={Advances in mobile computing along with recent emerging technologies such as the smart grid and cloud computing are paving the way for a wide range of mobile cloud networking services and applications. In the smart grid cyber-physical environment, smart mobile devices communicate with the smart grid ecosystem via the control center, which plays a central role in selling and buying energy from smart grid users. The smart grid cyber-physical system can be viewed as a hierarchical architecture made up of a cyber plane and a physical plane. All smart devices reside in the physical plane, whereas in the cyber plane computing and communication resources are provided by the cloud server-based control center in smart grid. We propose an intelligent, energy-efficient scheme in smart grid cyber-physical systems using coalition-based game theory. All smart devices located at the physical plane are taken as the players in the coalition game. We developed a payoff function for each player in the coalition game based on transmission of information and service delays using conditional entropy for various smart devices at the physical plane. We analyzed the existence of the Nash equilibrium with incomplete information using various actions performed by the players in the game in the proposed scheme. Finally, we evaluated the performance of our proposed solution using performance evaluation metrics such as energy difference, overhead generated, and delay incurred.},

abstract={With the increases in mobile usage, data sensors and IoT devices the classical Cloud approach encounters a lot of problems in network congestion and in the response speed. A method for optimizing the communication between the devices and the cloud is to place the computing power in the proximity of sources. Edge Computing is a paradigm that proposes data processing and storage at the edge of the network. For the Mobile Edge Computing, the edge is represented by pervasive Radio Access Networks. Edge computing addresses a variety of applications and use cases. For instance, edge model can be used in Smart Cities, Cyber-physical infrastructures, Wireless Sensors and Actuators Networks. In the model, the tasks and the data are submitted first on the gateway nodes, which are devices with computation and storage capabilities. In this way the latency is minimized, and the network bandwidth is preserved. In this paper we present the design and evaluation of a novel decentralized storage system for Edge Computing paradigm aiming to provide a unified storage for data generated by different edge devices.},

Smartphone and tablets have developed into popular devices with the proper permission from the message recipients for reading and watching many forms of mobile advertisement. Advertisers endeavor to attract their target customers by fully presenting their ads fluently. While 2D Animation has been a category of completely mature art forms, there is broad space for collaborative utilization on both commercial and artistic value. The animated film possesses excellent cost-performance ratio to be produced, broadcasted and decoded adaptively in various transmission and display media especially when it comes to real-time and personal-profiled plot placement marketing along with geo-information technologies. A cyber-physical system (CPS) framework for mobile advertising with location-based plot placement 2D animation has been derived and yet to be implemented and deployed. In this work, we derived the flowcharts and experience use case. A high-level operational architecture is then designed. Based on user experience theories, the marketing plans for plot placement are proposed and examined.

abstract={Cloud and Fog computing have established a convenient and widely adopted approach for computation offloading, where raw data generated by edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) context is collected and processed remotely. This vertical offloading pattern, however, typically does not take into account increasingly pressing time constraints of the emerging IoT scenarios, in which numerous data sources, including human agents (i.e., Social IoT), continuously generate large amounts of data to be processed in a timely manner. Big data solutions could be applied in this respect, provided that networking issues and limitations related to connectivity of edge devices are properly addressed. Although edge devices are traditionally considered to be resource-constrained, main limitations refer to energy, networking, and memory capacities, whereas their ever-growing processing capabilities are already sufficient to be effectively involved in actual (big data) processing. In this context, the role of human agents is no longer limited to passive data generation, but can also include their voluntary involvement in relatively complex computations. This way, users can share their personal computational resources (i.e., mobile phones) to support collaborative data processing, thereby turning the existing IoT into a global cyber-physical-social system (CPSS). To this extent, this paper proposes a novel IoT/CPSS data processing pattern based on the stream processing technology, aiming to distribute the workload among a cluster of edge devices, involving mobile nodes shared by contributors on a voluntary basis, and paving the way for cluster computing at the edge. Experiments on an intelligent surveillance system deployed on an edge device cluster demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, illustrating how its distributed in-memory data processing architecture can be effective.},

As one of the key members of IoT, Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has seen steep advancement in communication technologies. Now, vehicles can easily exchange safety, efficiency, infotainment, and comfort-related information with other vehicles and infrastructures using vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). We leverage on the cloud-based VANETs theme to propose cyber-physical architecture for the Social IoV (SIoV). SIoV is a vehicular instance of the Social IoT (SIoT), where vehicles are the key social entities in the machine-to-machine vehicular social networks. We have identified the social structures of SIoV components, their relationships, and the interaction types. We have mapped VANETs components into IoT-A architecture reference model to offer better integration of SIoV with other IoT domains. We also present a communication message structure based on automotive ontologies, the SAE J2735 message set, and the advanced traveler information system events schema that corresponds to the social graph. Finally, we provide the implementation details and the experimental analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system as well as include different application scenarios for various user groups.},

Also the MCC is expected to be a key technology for cyber physical systems by connecting to vehicular systems, medical systems, and other mission-critical systems. Therefore, it is a critical issue for MCC to guarantee the high reliability. In this paper, we consider the component importance analysis of an MCC with common-cause failures (CCFs) by using a Markov reward modelbased componentwise sensitivity approach. The component importance analysis is capable of quantifying the criticality of components and helps us to design the highly reliable system. In particular, this paper examines the effect of CCFs on the MCC. Our experimental results show that the preferred action to improve the availability of system with CCFs efficiently is to decrease the failure rate of the cloud node in the cloud infrastructure.},

abstract={Recently, along with the wide application of new generation information technologies (New IT) in manufacturing, many countries issued their national advanced manufacturing development strategies, such as Industrial Internet, Industry 4.0, and Made in China 2025. One common aim of these strategies is to achieve smart manufacturing, which demands the interoperation, integration, and fusion of the physical world and the cyber world of manufacturing. As well, New IT [such as Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, mobile Internet, and cyber-physical systems (CPS)] have played pivotal roles in promoting smart manufacturing. Data generated in the physical world can be sensed and transfered to the cyber world through IoT and the Internet, and be processed and analyzed by cloud computing, big data technologies to adjust the physical world. The physical world and the cyber world of manufacturing are integrated based on CPS. On the other hand, servitization has become a prominent trend in the manufacturing. Embracing the concept of “Manufacturing-as-a-Service,” manufacturing is provided as service for users. Because of the characteristics of interoperability and platform independence, services pave the way for large-scale smart applications and manufacturing collaboration. Combining New IT and services, this paper proposes a framework-New IT driven service-oriented smart manufacturing (SoSM). SoSM aims at facilitating the visions of smart manufacturing by making full use of New IT and services. Complementary to the framework of SoSM, the New IT driven typical characteristics of SoSM are also investigated and discussed, respectively.},

ThingML is based on a domain specific modelling languages integrating state-of-the-art concepts for modeling distributed systems, and comes with a set of compilers targeting a large set of platforms and communication protocols.

abstract={The fourth industrial revolution related to the Internet of Things (IoT) is leading to the emergence of future smart cities and cyber-physical systems with a rapidly increasing of smart connected objects (such as personal devices, sensors, actuators). Therefore, companies such as Telcos, Cloud and Service Providers have to analyze a huge amount of data that probably lead to the reduction of available bandwidth and subsequent increase of network latency. In this context, Fog Computing and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) can be suitable paradigms to solve this kind of problems. The exploitation of the heterogeneous environment allows a better performance for mission-critical and time-critical applications. In this paper we present a scenario that exploits the MECs in order to detect abnormal or critical events such as terrorist threats, natural and man-made disasters. The proposed solution allows cooperation among the Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) to rapidly notify the users which are close to the critical area.},

abstract={Detection of cyber attacks against vehicles is of growing interest. As vehicles typically afford limited processing resources, proposed solutions are rule-based or lightweight machine learning techniques. We argue that this limitation can be lifted with computational offloading commonly used for resource-constrained mobile devices. The increased processing resources available in this manner allow access to more advanced techniques. Using as case study a small four-wheel robotic land vehicle, we demonstrate the practicality and benefits of offloading the continuous task of intrusion detection that is based on deep learning. This approach achieves high accuracy much more consistently than with standard machine learning techniques and is not limited to a single type of attack or the in-vehicle CAN bus as previous work. As input, it uses data captured in real-time that relate to both cyber and physical processes, which it feeds as time series data to a neural network architecture. We use both a deep multilayer perceptron and recurrent neural network architecture, with the latter benefitting from a long-short term memory hidden layer, which proves very useful for learning the temporal context of different attacks. We employ denial of service, command injection and malware as examples of cyber attacks that are meaningful for a robotic vehicle. The practicality of computation offloading depends on the resources afforded onboard and remotely, and the reliability of the communication means between them. Using detection latency as the criterion, we have developed a mathematical model to determine when computation offloading is beneficial given parameters related to the operation of the network and the processing demands of the deep learning model. The more reliable the network and the greater the processing demands, the greater the reduction in detection latency achieved through offloading.},

abstract={Industry 4.0 represents the fourth phase of industry and manufacturing revolution, unique in that it provides Internet-connected smart systems, including automated factories, organizations, development on demand, and `just-in-time' development. Industry 4.0 includes the integration of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and fog computing paradigms for developing smart systems, smart homes, and smart cities. Given Industry 4.0 is comprised sensor fields, actuators, fog and cloud processing paradigms, and network systems, designing a secure architecture faces two major challenges: handling heterogeneous sources at scale and maintaining security over a large, disparate, data-driven system that interacts with the physical environment. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a new threat intelligence scheme that models the dynamic interactions of industry 4.0 components including physical and network systems. The scheme consists of two components: a smart management module and a threat intelligence module. The smart data management module handles heterogeneous data sources, one of the foundational requirements for interacting with an Industry 4.0 system. This includes data to and from sensors, actuators, in addition to other forms of network traffic. The proposed threat intelligence technique is designed based on beta mixture-hidden Markov models (MHMMs) for discovering anomalous activities against both physical and network systems. The scheme is evaluated on two well-known datasets: the CPS dataset of sensors and actuators and the UNSW-NB15 dataset of network traffic. The results reveal that the proposed technique outperforms five peer mechanisms, suggesting its effectiveness as a viable deployment methodology in real-Industry 4.0 systems.},

abstract={Modernizing our critical infrastructure often involves upgrades with Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to enhance efficiency, safety and reliability. New security and resilience requirements and challenges arise given the mission- and time-critical nature of CPS applications. These applications are always targeted by sophisticated persistent attacks exploiting potential cyber-physical integration vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present CyPhyCARD (Cooperative Autonomous Resilient Defense “CARD” platform for Cyber Physical Systems) as a resilient and secure defense cloud. The foundation of CyPhyCARD is our Cell-Oriented Architecture (COA) that enables distributed, dynamically configurable, and runtime-programmable platforms. COA comprises composable intrinsically resilient, active components termed “Cells” that dynamically manage heterogeneous resources and executable software code variants to execute CyPhyCARD defense missions. CyPhyCARD uses our generic Evolutionary Sensory system (EvoSense) to circulate context-driven, functionally customizable sensors and effectors through the target of defense. EvoSense provides cooperative autonomous control and sharing amongst interconnected defense service providers (CyPhyCARD) and/or their target of defense to enhance attack detection and deterrence. Further, CyPhyCARD uses our ChameleonSoft system to secure its infrastructure of cells. ChameleonSoft is a multidimensional software diversity system that autonomously induces runtime confusion and diffusion thereby, in effect, encrypting the spatiotemporal software behavior and realizing a moving target defense. Both EvoSense and ChameleonSoft are built using the COA. CyPhyCARD is designed to increase the cost for the attacker at all times through persistently asymmetric operations achieved, in part, using a moving target defense construction and automated recovery provided by ChameleonSoft; rabid global attack detection and mitigation through EvoSense; and Operation resilience in presence of attacks using attack containment and honeypots defense missions. We demonstrate, using an attack scenario, how our proposed solution reacts to threats targeting CyPhyCARD and/or its target of defense systems.},

abstract={Taking advantage of IoT, services and Cloud technologies, the development of Cloud of Things (CoT) changes the way control applications are engineered and developed. CoT helps to move from a dedicated design and development of control applications to a Control as a Service vision, relying on Cyber Physical System (CPS) composition and orchestration. This vision requires developing a new architecture to provide a loosely coupled way to interconnect objects and control software, mixing both logical and physical constraints. To fit this challenge, we propose a Control as a Service model, extending the Cloud XaaS model to automation. To this end, we design a Control Service, gathering both functional and non functional specifications to describe each component of the system. By this way, control applications can be implemented by selecting and composing these control services associated to the different sensors, controllers and actuators. Fitting the loosely coupled principle of the service oriented architecture, we introduce a data manager component used to store the information produced and exchanged by control components (sensors and controllers) and an event manager, in charge of invoking the services when all the necessary input information are available. A prototype hosting a simulated smart city control application, distributed on different machines, is presented.},

abstract={Mobile edge cloud is emerging as a promising technology to internet of things and cyber physical system applications such as smart home and intelligent video surveillance. In smart home, various sensors are deployed to monitor the home environment and physiological health of individuals. The data collected by sensors are sent to an application, where numerous algorithms for emotion and sentiment detection, activity recognition and situation management are applied to provide healthcare- and emergency-related services and to manage resources at the home. The executions of these algorithms require a vast amount of computing and storage resources. To address the issue, the conventional approach is to send the collected data to an application on an internet cloud. This approach has several problems such as high communication latency, communication energy consumption and unnecessary data traffic to the core network. To overcome the drawbacks of the conventional cloud-based approach, a new system called mobile edge cloud is proposed. In mobile edge cloud, multiple mobile and stationary devices interconnected through wireless local area networks are combined to create a small cloud infrastructure at a local physical area such as home. Compared to traditional mobile distributed computing systems, mobile edge cloud introduces several complex challenges due to the heterogeneous computing environment, heterogeneous and dynamic network environment, node mobility, and limited battery power. The real time requirements associated with internet of things and cyber physical system applications make the problem even more challenging. In this paper, we describe the applications and challenges associated with design and development of mobile edge cloud system and propose an architecture based on a cross layer design approach for effective decision making.},

abstract={Along with the invention of computers and interconnected networks, physical societal notions like security, trust, and privacy entered the digital environment. The concept of digital environments begins with the trust (established in the real world) in the organisation/individual that manages the digital resources. This concept evolved to deal with the rapid growth of the Internet, where it became impractical for entities to have prior offline (real world) trust. The evolution of digital trust took diverse approaches and now trust is defined and understood differently across heterogeneous domains. This paper looks at digital trust from the point of view of security and examines how valid trust approaches from other domains are now making their way into secure computing. The paper also revisits and analyses the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) along with associated technologies and their relevance in the changing landscape. We especially focus on the domains of cloud computing, mobile computing and cyber-physical systems. In addition, the paper also explores our proposals that are competing with and extending the traditional functionality of TPM specifications.},

abstract={The goal of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) is to enable easy cooperation of a large number of computers and orchestration of services that are connected via a network. However, SOA for wireless sensor networks (WSN) and cyber-physical systems (CPS) is still a challenging task. Consequently, for design and development of large CPS like WSNs connected to clouds, SOA has not yet evolved as an integral technology. One of the limiting issues is service registration and discovery. In large CPS discovery of services is tedious, mostly due to the fact that services are often semantically bound to a region or an application function while SOA forces service endpoints to be based on addresses of nodes. Also, today, SOA technologies are not used for service composition within sensor nodes and between sensor nodes, and even worse, different methods exist for service access in a WSN and in the backend. Therefore, service development differs largely in WSN and cloud. To overcome this limitation, we suggest a name-centric service architecture for cyber-physical systems. Our architecture is based on (a) using URNs instead of URLs to provide a service-centric architecture instead of service-or location-centric networking, (b) using the well-known CCNx protocol as a basis for our architecture which supports location and access transparency, and (c) employing CCN-WSN as the resource-efficient lightweight implementation for WSNs to build a name-based service bus for CPS. We evaluate the architecture by implementing an example application for facility management.},

Cities can be perceived as an ecosystem of "things" which citizens daily interact with: street furniture, public buildings, transportation, monuments, public lighting as well as personal smartphones. Thanks to recent advances in ICT such things can be considered always interconnected also providing sensing and actuating facilities according to the Internet of Things and Cyber Physical Systems models. Creating smart services that exploit such a complex infrastructure is a fundamental and current challenge. To this end, aim of this paper is the design and implementation of the Software Defined Cities approach: a Cloud-based infrastructure that, starting from the well known concept of Software Defined paradigms, is able to transform this complex ecosystem in a simple and "programmable" environment where municipalities, companies, scientists, and citizens can easily collaborate in developing innovative smart services.

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of devising an effective information fusion architecture for a task scheduling algorithm which facilitates data processing of a Cyber Physical System (CPS) under bounded latency for bursty or lossy traffic. Task scheduling traditionally caters to real-time systems where a feedback loop does not exist allowing the serviced application to be independent of the inputs from the server. However, owing to the nature of a near real-time CPS, such liberties cannot be entertained. Additionally, the advent of big data in CPS has necessitated the use of Cloud Computing as a scalable and cost effective alternative. Task scheduling in such CPSs, where inputs from the Cloud complete the feedback loop is a major research issue. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-layered information fusion architecture which integrates such a task scheduling mechanism by accommodating both traffic bursts and packet losses. Our scheduling algorithm ensures that the overall latency always remains under an acceptable upper bound as required by the CPS application.},

abstract={Nowadays, the growing global economy and demand for customized products are bringing the manufacturing industry from a sellers' market toward a buyers' market. In this context, the smart manufacturing enabled by Industry 4.0 is changing the whole production cycle of companies specialized on different kinds of products. On one hand, the advent of cloud computing and social media makes the customers' experience more and more inclusive, whereas on the other hand cyber-physical system technologies help industries to change in real time the cycle of production according to customers' needs. In this context, “retention”marketing strategies aimed not only at the acquisition of new customers but also at the profitability of existing ones allow industries to apply specific production strategies so as to maximize their revenues. This is possible by means of the analysis of various kinds of information coming from customers, products, purchases, and so on. In this paper, we focus on customer loyalty programs. In particular, we propose cloud-based software as a service architecture that store and analyses big data related to purchases and products' ranks in order to provide customers a list of recommended products. Experiments focus on a prototype of human to machine workflow for the pre-selection of customers deployed on both private and hybrid cloud scenarios.},

abstract={This paper presents a model-based approach to generate configurable software architectures of so called Cloud-based Cyber-Physical Systems (CCPS). Cloud computing makes dynamically scalable computing power and data storage available. These advantages are included in the design of Cloud-based Cyber-Physical Systems. The designed platform architecture is evaluated by two scenarios of automation engineering. The different scenarios of camera-based process monitoring are analyzed and subject of a timing analysis, an energy consumption estimation as well as a cost analysis. Significant improvements concerning processing time are shown and the energy optimal solution is identified. Moreover the most cost-effective solution is highlighted.},

abstract={In recent trends, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things interpret an evolution of computerized integration connectivity. The specific research challenges in CPS as security, privacy, data analytics, participate sensing, smart decision making. In addition, The challenges in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) includes secure architecture, energy efficient protocols and quality of services. In this paper, we present an architectures of CPS and its protocols and applications. We propose software related mobile sensing paradigm namely Mobile Sensor Information Agent (MSIA). It works as plug-in based for CPS middleware and scalable applications in mobile devices. The working principle MSIA is acts intermediary device and gathers data from a various external sensors and its upload to cloud on demand. CPS needs tight integration between cyber world and man-made physical world to achieve stability, security, reliability, robustness, and efficiency in the system. Emerging software-defined networking (SDN) can be integrated as the communication infrastructure with CPS infrastructure to accomplish such system. Thus we propose a possible SDN-based CPS framework to improve the performance of the system.},

abstract={A Cyber-Physical Manufacturing Cloud (CPMC) is an Internet-of-Things (IoT) enabled manufacturing framework that facilitates monitoring and operation of manufacturing machine tools remotely through the integration of IoT, cyber-physical systems, cloud computing, and advanced manufacturing technologies. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop a communication method of manufacturing services over the Internet in order to access and manage manufacturing resources from the cloud. This paper presents a semantic ontology based Internet scale communication method of manufacturing services named Machine Tool Communication (MTComm) in a CPMC to enable manufacturing with various physically connected machines from geographically distributed locations over the Internet. This paper presents design of an agent-adapter architecture of the communication method of exchanging manufacturing services across Internet, a semantic ontological representation of manufacturing machines and services, and specification of the ontology based MTComm method. It is the first Internet scale manufacturing service communication method of enabling manufacturing operations over the internet in addition to monitoring manufacturing services. MTComm is a significant improvement over the MTConnect, a widely popular communication method of manufacturing services which allows only monitoring machine tools over the Internet. It is implemented and tested in a testbed of the CPMC to analyze its performance in multiple manufacturing application scenarios. The experiments demonstrate excellent feasibility of monitoring and performing manufacturing operations over the Internet.},

abstract={Operational Technology (OT) networks existed well before the dawn of the Internet, and had enjoyed security through being air-gapped and isolated. However, the interconnectedness of the world has found its way into these OT networks, exposing their vulnerabilities for cyber attacks. As the global Internet continues to grow, it becomes more and more embedded with the physical world. The Internet of Things is one such example of how IT is blurring the cyber-physical boundaries. The eventuality will be a convergence of IT and OT. Until that day comes, cyber practitioners must still deal with the primitive security features of OT networks, maintain a foothold on enterprise and cloud networks, and attempt to instill sound security practices in burgeoning IoT networks. In this paper, we propose a new method to bring cyber security to OT and IoT-based networks, through Multi-agent Systems (MAS). MAS are flexible enough to integrate with fixed legacy networks, such as ICS, as well with be burned into newer devices and software, such as IoT and IT networks. In this paper, we discuss the features of MAS, the opportunities that exist to benefit cyber security, and a proposed architecture for a OT-based MAS.},

abstract={The MEC vision leverages the availability of powerful and low-cost middleboxes, statically deployed at suitable edges of the network and acting as local proxies for the centralized cloud backbone; this potentially enables, among other things, better scalability and better reactivity in the interaction with mobile nodes via local control decisions and actuation. MEC has already been proposed as an enabler for several Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems application scenarios, and also mutual benefits due to the integration of MEC and mobile crowdsensing (MCS). The article originally proposes human-driven edge computing (HEC) as a new model to ease the provisioning and to extend the coverage of traditional MEC solutions. From a methodological perspective, we show how it is possible to exploit MCS i) to support the effective deployment of fixed MEC (FMEC) proxies and ii) to further extend their coverage through the introduction of impromptu and human-enabled mobile MEC (M2EC) proxies. In addition, we describe how we have implemented these novel concepts in the MCS ParticipAct platform through the integration of the MEC Elijah platform in the ParticipAct living lab, an ongoing MCS real-world experiment that involved about 170 students at the University of Bologna for more than two years. Reported experimental results quantitatively show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques in elastically scaling the load at edge nodes according to runtime provisioning needs.},

abstract={The aim of the MANTIS project is to provide a proactive maintenance service platform architecture based on Cyber Physical Systems. The platform will allow estimating future performance, predicting and preventing imminent failures and scheduling proactive maintenance. Maintenance is an important element that creates added value in the business processes and it also creates new business models with a stronger service orientation. Physical systems and the environment they work in are continuously monitored by a range of intelligent sensors, resulting in massive amounts of data, which characterise the usage history, working condition, location, movement and other physical properties of the systems. These systems are part of a larger network of heterogeneous and collaborative systems (e.g. vehicle fleets) connected via robust communication mechanisms able to operate in challenging environments. MANTIS consists of distributed processing chains that efficiently transform raw data into knowledge, while minimising the need for bandwidth. Sophisticated distributed sensing and decision-making functions are performed at different levels collaboratively, ranging from local nodes to locally optimise performance, bandwidth and maintenance; to cloud-based platforms that integrate information from diverse systems and execute distributed processing and analytics algorithms for global decision-making.},

An attractive way to coordinate the situation and ensure resilience in lineal times could be through redundancy-based restoration mechanisms. For this reason, in this article, we present a network infrastructure based on three layers, where the redundant support is primarily concentrated on a fog-based structure to protect a specific subset of cyber-physical control devices. The specification of the context and the abstract construction of the approach include a set of conceptual theories related to structural controllability, power dominance, supernode, and opinion dynamics, where the validation of the approach is subject to a practical analysis based on two threat case studies.},

abstract={Smart Farming is a development that emphasizes on the use of modern technologies in the cyber-physical field management cycle. Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing have accelerated the digital transformation of the conventional agricultural practices promising increased production rate and product quality. The adoption of smart farming though is hampered because of the lack of models providing guidance to practitioners regarding the necessary components that constitute IoT based monitoring systems. To guide the process of designing and implementing Smart farming monitoring systems, in this paper we propose a generic reference architecture model, taking also into consideration a very important non-functional requirement, the energy consumption restriction. Moreover, we present and discuss the technologies that incorporate the four layers of the architecture model that are the Sensor Layer, the Network Layer, the Service Layer and the Application Layer. A discussion is also conducted upon the challenges that smart farming monitoring systems face.},

Mobile Internet Device (MID), as a portable handheld device designed for mobility providing a down-graded computing capability, can be used as a strong candidate for client-side devices in CPS. Since these physical devices have limited resources, it is not possible to execute complex computation and processes. To cope with this challenge, we apply Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) or Cloud Computing (CC) concepts to CPS, called a service-based CPS. To realize a service-based CPS, we first define overall architecture with three tiers. And, we present key methods to design each tier in the architecture. The design methods are defined to deal with design challenges of CPSs such as dynamic composition, dynamic adaptation, and high confidence CPS management. Then, we perform a case study to show applicability of our approach. With this approach, we hope that CPS can even handle complex and resource-consuming physical processes with a downsized MID.},

abstract={An emerging hyper-world encompasses all human activities in a social-cyber-physical space. Its power derives from the Wisdom Web of Things (W2T) cycle, namely, "from things to data, information, knowledge, wisdom, services, humans, and then back to things."' The W2T cycle leads to a harmonious symbiosis among humans, computers, and things, which can be constructed by large-scale converging of intelligent information technology applications with an open and interoperable architecture. The recent advances in cloud computing, the Internet of Things, Web of Things, Big Data, and other research fields have provided just such an open system architecture with resource sharing and services. The next step is to develop an open and interoperable content architecture with intelligent sharing and services for the organization and transformation in the data, information, knowledge, and wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy. This article introduces wisdom as a service (WaaS), a content architecture based on the pay-as-you-go IT trend. The WaaS infrastructure and the main challenges in WaaS research and applications are discussed. A case study is also described. Relying on cloud computing and big data, WaaS provides a practical approach to realize the W2T cycle in the hyper-world for the coming age of ubiquitous intelligent IT applications.},

abstract={The development of safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is expanding due to the Internet of Things' promise to make high-integrity applications and services part of everyday life. This expansion is seen in the dependencies some connected vehicles have on cloud services that provide guidance and accident avoidance / detection features. Such systems are safety-critical since failure could result in serious injury or death. Due to the severe consequences of failure, fault-tolerance, reliability and dependability should be primary driving qualities in the design and development of these systems. However, the cost of the analysis, evaluation and certification activities needed to ensure that the possibility of failure has been sufficiently mitigated is significantly higher than the cost of developing traditional software. Our group is exploring the addition of dynamic adaptive capabilities to safety-critical systems. We postulate that dynamic adaptivity could provide several enhancements to safety-critical systems. It would allow systems to reason about the environment within which they are sited and about their internal operation enabling decision making that is context-specific and appropriately prioritized. However, the addition of adaptivity with the associated overhead of reasoning is not without drawbacks particularly when hard real-time safety-critical systems are involved. In this brief position paper, we explore some of the questions and concerns that are raised when dynamic adaptive behavior is introduced into safety-critical systems as well as ways that the Architecture Analysis & Design Language (AADL) can be used to model / analyze such systems.},

abstract={Population in the urban areas around the world is increasing yet energy and natural resources which are non-renewable, have continued to deplete. This scenario leads us to the many challenges faced by public transportation since it is directly linked to urbanization. From a civilian point of view, proper travel planning and knowledge of others' travel experiences are useful in easing public transportation woes. We apply Cyber Physical System (CPS) within cyber-physical-socio space to make those capabilities possible. In this approach, we regard data as a service, data are contributed and queried by the public masses. Location and time represent the physical domain and data with information derived from them represent the digital domain in our CPS design. We designed and implemented a prototypical system named ContriSenseCloud that works based on client-server model. The system has two main distinctive platforms, namely Service Exchange Platform (SEP) and Application-specific Exchange Platform (AEP). The SEP is designed to be as generalizable as possible whereas AEP is where our current public transportation applications reside. Such architecture enables extensibility of ContriSenseCloud to other application domains. Other contributions include Restful Application Programming Interface (API) in CPS, near real-time sensing, and mapping of GPS readings to correct sequence of bus stops.},

abstract={Cloud computing is revolutionizing the backbone of data analysis applications, including industrial ones. One of its main pillars is the separation of the logic with which data is accessed (e.g., to study the efficiency of a manufacturing system) from the actual hardware (e.g., server) that maintains and analyses the data. Large distributed cyber-physical systems enabled by, among other technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), made nonetheless clear that “what to do” with the data and “where to do it” are not disjoint problems; i.e., cloud computing on its own is not enough. Fog and edge computing have emerged as complementary options, to distribute the analysis, helping with challenges by means of close-to-the-source data analysis.We show for a key problem for industrial processes, that of shifting bottleneck detection, how to take advantage of such multi-tier computing architectures, to perform continuous and configurable analysis of data from Manufacturing Execution Systems. We propose a processing framework, STRATUM, and an algorithm, AMBLE, for continuous, data stream processing. STRATUM seamlessly distributes and parallelizes the processing across the tiers and AMBLE guarantees consistent analysis in spite of timing fluctuations, which are commonly introduced due to e.g. the communication system; it also achieves efficiency through appropriate data structures for in-memory processing. The experimental study on a real-world dataset, taken from a production line over two years and including 8.5 million entries, shows the benefits of the proposed solution in enabling configurable and efficient analysis.},

Nonetheless, this technological advancement also exposed ICPS to significant cyber threats. This paper contributes to the development of a cross-layer anomaly detection system (ADS) for ICPS by defining a lightweight detection methodology that leverages Dempster-Shafer's "Theory of Evidence" in order to: infer the system's state; fuse evidence from a wide range of monitored parameters; and deliver a comprehensive and scalable detection system.

abstract={The industry is constantly moving towards the research, implementation and deployment of new solutions that permit the optimization of processes. Nowadays, such solutions consist mostly on ICT developments, which permit the collection, distribution, integration, analysis, and manipulation of heterogeneous data. The under way Cloud Collaborative Manufacturing Networks (C2NET) project targets the development of cloud-enabled tools for supporting the SMEs supply network optimization of manufacturing and logistic assets. The C2NET solution includes the implementation of paradigms as e.g. cloud computing or service-oriented and event-driven architectures, used for wide data integration. Among its requirements, the C2NET platform needs a solution for catch, process and react to events triggered in different locations of collaborative manufacturing networks, which are endowed with devices that permits the integration of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This paper presents the architecture and main functionality of a knowledge-based approach that allows processing supply chain events handled by CPS devices. The main component of the presented solution is the SECA ontology, which is a knowledge base that can be updated at runtime. The main purpose of the ontology is to describe events, their status and the actions to be performed once a set of events are triggered in certain order. This research work offers a solution that can be employed by the C2NET platform not only to catch and process events; but also to notify linked data consumers.},

pages={41395-41415}, 
abstract={The recent advances in cyber-physical domains, cloud, cloudlet, and edge platforms along with the evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, big data analytics, and cutting-edge wireless communication technologies within the Industry 4.0 (4IR) are urging mechatronics designers, practitioners, and educators to further review the ways in which mechatronics systems are perceived, designed, manufactured, and advanced. Within this scope, we introduce the service-oriented cyber-physical advanced mechatronics systems (AMSs) along with current and future challenges. The objective in AMSs is to create remarkably intelligent autonomous products by 1) forging effective sensing, self-learning, Wisdom as a Service (WaaS), Information as a Service (InaaS), precise decision making, and actuation using effective location-independent monitoring, control and management techniques with products and 2) maintaining a competitive edge through better product performances via immediate and continuous learning, while the products are being used by customers and are being produced in factories within the cycle of Automation of Everything (AoE). With the advanced wireless communication techniques and improved battery technologies, the AMSs are capable of getting independent and working with other massive AMSs to construct robust, customizable, energy-efficient, autonomous, intelligent, and immersive platforms. In this regard, rather than providing technological details, this paper implements philosophical insights into 1) how mechatronics systems are being transformed into AMSs; 2) how robust AMSs can be developed by both exploiting the wisdom created within cyber-physical smart domains in the edge and cloud platforms and incorporating all the stakeholders with diverse objectives into all phases of the product life-cycle; and 3) what essential common features AMSs should acquire to increase the efficacy of products and prolong their product life. Against this background, an AMS development framework is proposed in order to contextualize all the necessary phases of AMS development and direct all stakeholders to rivet high-quality products and services within AoE.},

abstract={The world of connected devices has led to the rise of the Internet of Things paradigm, where applications rely on multiple devices, gathering and sharing data across highly heterogeneous networks. The variety of possible mechanisms, protocols, and hardware has become a hindrance in the development of architectures capable of addressing the most common IoT use cases, while abstracting services from the underlying communication subsystem. Moreover, the world is moving toward new strict requirements in terms of timeliness and low latency in combination with ultra-high availability and reliability. Thus, future IoT architectures will also have to support the requirements of these cyber-physical applications. In this regard, edge computing has been presented as one of the most promising solutions, relying on the cooperation of nodes by moving services directly to end devices and caching information locally. Therefore, in this article, we propose a modular and scalable architecture based on lightweight virtualization. The provided modularity, combined with the orchestration supplied by Docker, simplifies management and enables distributed deployments, creating a highly dynamic system. Moreover, characteristics such as fault tolerance and system availability are achieved by distributing the application logic across different layers, where failures of devices and micro-services can be masked by this natively redundant architecture, with minimal impact on the overall system performance. Experimental results have validated the implementation of the proposed architecture for on-demand services deployment across different architecture layers.},

As a result, set-up processes has to be shorter and more resilient because of the increasing number of variants. To meet future requirements, the processes need to be self-adaptive and reconfigurable at any time. Nowadays, a shift of the automation pyramid to interconnected cyber physical systems can be observed as well as emerging technologies as cloud and edge computing are introduced to production systems. These technologies in combination with the Digital Shadow, which provides information about all production assets, open up potential for an adaptive process control and an overall life cycle data management. For this, the Digital Shadow has to be used not only for the aggregation of data, but also for pushing data back into the system and to control the process. As a result, services in regard to an architecture based on edge computing as an enabling technology for an adaptive production together with the Digital Shadow are presented, implemented and discussed on the basis of an industrial use case.},

abstract={Disasters whether natural or man-made have great impact on countries and civilians. Proper information across the main disaster phases need to be delivered on time and to the right people to minimize the impact and provide needed resources. Social media and Twitter in particular, is an important mean of information sharing in real-time as part of a complete cyber-physical emergency management system during a disaster. Twitter can be used in any place in the world through smartphones or other mediums with an internet access connection. The vast and varied number of tweets produced during a disaster will benefit from the cloud scalable storage and processing resources. As a centralized processing system is more vulnerable when a disaster strikes, there is a need for a more resilient distributed system architecture that allows for the distribution of both processing and storage resources. The goal of our study is to develop and evaluate a prototype of a microservice architecture for twitter data analytics during a disaster that meets the requirements of disaster management. In this paper, we design a cloud-based microservices twitter analytics framework for disaster management and implement a basic prototype system. Our prototype system demonstrates that the microservices approach allows for a distributed, dynamic, reliable and scalable system architecture on cloud platform that goes in hand with disaster domain requirements.},

The contribution of this work is an application-independent approach for dynamic management of IT-resources in CPS, which forms an SOA-based, easy adaptable solution-pattern. Therefore, a resource-based view on CPS, based on the resource-stack model from cloud computing, is introduced as a layer of abstraction. A resource-manager decides which resource to scale and how. The concept is evaluated by an application example from the field of process engineering. Finally, a qualitative evaluation of the described method is performed.},

abstract={The diversity of power sources for electricity generation excites the current smart grid to evolve towards Cyber-Physical Energy System (CPES), which integrates with other systems, such as natural gas and heat. By advanced communication technologies, CPES can achieve effective energy fusion, real-time computation and precise control. With the increasing number of energy applications that bring large quantities of data, it calls for sufficient computing and storage resources with fast transmission and powerful processing to satisfy users' service level agreements (SLAs). This paper presents a multi-layered distributed cloud network (MDC) for CPES, with the design of the physical integration of energy systems, a distributed cloud architecture and a hierarchal information structure based on the fifth generation (5G). Furthermore, we present a two-level resource allocation model for cloud network, which aims to decide the location of deploying cloud facilities and dynamically adjust the number of virtual machines (VMs) to deal with the demand variation. We also simplify the model to only one level utilizing scalarization. The simulation shows the proposed model performs effectively compared to centralized solutions.},

This is a challenge for educators, in particular when it comes to creating hands-on experiences of real systems, due to their complexity and the fact that they are usually proprietary. Therefore, a laboratory environment that is representative of the industrial solutions is needed, with a focus on software and systems engineering issues. This paper describes such an environment, called the Mobile Open Platform for Experimental Design (MOPED). It consists of a model car chassis, equipped with a network of three control units based on standard hardware, and running the automotive software standard AUTOSAR, which consists of operating system, middleware, and application software structures. It is equipped with various sensors and actuators, and is open to extensions both in hardware and software. It also contains elements of future systems, since it allows connectivity to cloud services, development of federated embedded systems, and continuous deployment of new functionality. In this way, the platform provides a very relevant learning environment for cyber-physical systems, today and in the future.},

abstract={Medical devices are complex cyber-physical systems incorporating emergent hardware and software components. However, this complexity leads to a wide attack surface posing security risks and vulnerabilities. Mitigation and management of such risks during premarket design and postmarket deployment are required. Dynamically mitigating threat potential in the presence of unknown vulnerabilities requires an adaptive risk-based scheme to assess the system's state, a secure system architecture that can isolate hardware and software components, and design methods that can adaptively adjust the system's topology based on risk changes. The essential complementary aspects during deployment are detecting, characterizing, and quantifying security threats. This article presents a dynamic risk management and mitigation approach based on probabilistic threat estimation. A smart-connected-pacemaker case study illustrates the approach. This article is part of a special issue on Software Safety and Security Risk Mitigation in Cyber-physical Systems.},

abstract={Cloud computing-based data centers, which hold a large amount of customer data, are vulnerable to physical attacks and insider threats. Current protection and defense mechanisms for security of data held in data centers are either completely physical (sensors, barriers, etc.) or completely cyber (firewalls, encryption, etc.). In this paper we propose a novel cyber-physical security defense for cloud computing-based data centers against physical attacks. In our system, physical sensors detect an impending physical/human attack which triggers cyber defenses to protect or mitigate the attack. The key to the cyber defenses is that in cloud computing data centers the data is loosely coupled with the underlying physical hardware, and can be moved/migrated to other physical hardware in the presence of an attack. In this paper we propose a model for coupling such cyber defenses with physical attack-detection sensors. We further describe a preliminary architecture for building such a system with today's cloud computing infrastructure.},

abstract={The following decade will witness a surge in remote health-monitoring systems that are based on body-worn monitoring devices. These Medical Cyber Physical Systems (MCPS) will be capable of transmitting the acquired data to a private or public cloud for storage and processing. Machine learning algorithms running in the cloud and processing this data can provide decision support to healthcare professionals. There is no doubt that the security and privacy of the medical data is one of the most important concerns in designing an MCPS. In this paper, we depict the general architecture of an MCPS consisting of four layers: data acquisition, data aggregation, cloud processing, and action. Due to the differences in hardware and communication capabilities of each layer, different encryption schemes must be used to guarantee data privacy within that layer. We survey conventional and emerging encryption schemes based on their ability to provide secure storage, data sharing, and secure computation. Our detailed experimental evaluation of each scheme shows that while the emerging encryption schemes enable exciting new features such as secure sharing and secure computation, they introduce several orders-of-magnitude computational and storage overhead. We conclude our paper by outlining future research directions to improve the usability of the emerging encryption schemes in an MCPS.},

The agent-based manufacturing is a highly distributed control paradigm that can cope with these challenges well. This paper gives an overview of agent-based architectures for manufacturing systems. Besides, a cloud-assisted self-organized architecture is presented by comprising smart agents and cloud to communicate and negotiate through networks. Ontological representations of knowledge base are constructed to provide the information basis for decision-making of agents, which enables dynamic reconfiguration among agents in a collaborative way to achieve agility and flexibility. Furthermore, the agents' interaction behavior is modeled to structure the agents hierarchically to reduce the complexity, because the interactions among agents in distributed system are difficult to understand and predict. The experimental results show that the presented architecture can be easily deployed to build smart manufacturing system and can improve the adaptiveness and robustness of the manufacturing system when dealing with mixed multi-product tasks.},

abstract={In distributed digitalized environments in the context of the Internet of Things, we often need to do an analysis of big data originating at high rate-sensors at the edge of the infrastructure. A characteristic example is the light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology, that allows sensing surrounding objects with fine-grained resolution in large areas. Their data (known as point clouds), generated continuously at very high rates, through appropriate analysis can provide information to support automated functionality in distributed cyber-physical? systems; clustering of point clouds is a key problem to extract this type of information. Methods for solving the problem in a continuous fashion can facilitate improved processing in fog architectures, through enabling low-latency, efficient continuous and streaming processing of data close to the sources; moreover, parallelism is a key requirement to exploit a variety of computing architectures in this context. We proposeLisco, a single-pass continuous Euclidean-distance-based clustering of LiDAR point clouds, that maximizes the granularity of the data processing pipeline and thus shows the potential for data-and pipeline-parallelism. We further present its parallel version, P-Lisco, that is architecture-independent and exploits the parallelism revealed byLisco'salgorithmic approach. Besides their algorithmic analysis, we provide a thorough experimental evaluation on architectures representative of high-end servers and of resource-constrained embedded devices and highlight the multiplicative improvements and scalability benefits of the proposed algorithms compared to the baseline, using both real-world datasets as well as synthetic ones to fully explore a wide spectrum of stress-levels for the algorithms.},

abstract={The Internet of Things is expected to contribute to a "smarter world" by connecting the physical to the virtual, i.e., enabling advanced knowledge engineering over the big data gathered about the physical world. However, such a promise comes along with high resource consumption, spanning the network, storage and computational resources, not to mention possible security and privacy threats. As a result, it tends to be admitted that the IoT smartness will not be accommodated at scale by a centralized cloud-based approach. Instead, the deployment of IoT systems needs to leverage a highly distributed system architecture, which optimizes the distribution of the computation -from the edge to the cloud-according to the unique business requirements in terms of financial cost, latency, availability, etc. Toward that goal, this paper introduces the LATTICE framework, which aims at taming the complexity of configuring edge-based IoT systems. LATTICE builds upon ontologies that have proven useful to characterize the constituents of IoT systems in the required domain-specific way. However, LATTICE also revisits the exploitation of ontologies -i.e., the formal description of the real world, spanning the physical and cyber entities-across the development life-cycle of the IoT systems. As a first evidence, this paper introduces an automated approach to the optimization of IoT system configurations at the edge, provided the ontological description of the target IoT system.},

abstract={The rapid growth in the transportation sector has led to the emergence of smart vehicles that are equipped with ICT. These modern smart vehicles are connected to the Internet to access various services such as road condition information, infotainment, and energy management. This kind of scenario can be viewed as a vehicular cyber-physical system (VCPS) where the vehicles are at the physical layer and services are at the cyber layer. However, network traffic management is the biggest issue in the modern VCPS scenario as the mismanagement of network resources can degrade the quality of service (QoS) for end users. To deal with this issue, we propose a software defined networking (SDN)-enabled approach, named SeDaTiVe, which uses deep learning architecture to control the incoming traffic in the network in the VCPS environment. The advantage of using deep learning in network traffic control is that it learns the hidden patterns in data packets and creates an optimal route based on the learned features. Moreover, a virtual-controller-based scheme for flow management using SDN in VCPS is designed for effective resource utilization. The simulation scenario comprising 1000 vehicles seeking various services in the network is considered to generate the dataset using SUMO. The data obtained from the simulation study is evaluated using NS-2, and proves that the proposed scheme effectively handles real-time incoming requests in VCPS. The results also depict the improvement in performance on various evaluation metrics like delay, throughput, packet delivery ratio, and network load by using the proposed scheme over the traditional SDN and TCP/IP protocol suite.},

abstract={The Industry 4.0 paradigm alludes to a new industrial revolution where factories evolve towards digitalized and networked structures where intelligence is spread among the different elements of the production systems. Two key technological enablers to achieve the flexibility and efficiency sought for factories of the future are the communication networks and the data management schemes that will support connectivity and data distribution in Cyber-Physical Production Systems. Communications and data management must be built upon a flexible and reliable architecture to be able to efficiently meet the stringent and varying requirements in terms of latency, reliability and data rates demanded by industrial applications, and with particular attention on time-critical automation. To this aim, this paper proposes the use of heterogeneous communication technologies integrated in a hierarchical communications and data management architecture where decentralized and local management decisions are coordinated by a central orchestrator that ensures the efficient global operation of the system. Industrial applications are organized in different tiers where different management strategies are applied to satisfy their different requirements in terms of latency and reliability. The use of virtualization and softwarization technologies as RAN Slicing and Cloud RAN will allow to achieve the flexibility, scalability and adaptation capabilities required to support the high-demanding and diverse industrial environment.},

abstract={In recent years, climate change, high population rates, water scarcity, contaminated farmland, eroding soils, and other factors, have raised serious concerns in the area of sustainable food production. In addition, it has been estimated that by 2050, as much as 80 percent of the earths population will reside in cities [1]. As a consequence, new forms of food production have been explored, especially in places close to or even within the consumption areas, that is, cities. In this context, cities are evolving into intelligent infrastructures in which the aim is to automate, optimize, and improve all possible aspects, including urban agriculture and precision agronomy. Despite recent research efforts, common grounds still have to be defined in terms of how to efficiently automate and provide intelligence to the urban agriculture implementations and integrate those in a transparent and scalable manner to the overall smart city solutions. For this, we believe that smart cities must be conceptualized and abstracted on a higher and different plane than the supporting information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure. However, the essential properties that make a city smart or a system of systems must be the architectural design assets of the underlying planes. This paper presents a conceptual IoT architecture for urban farming and precision agronomy in Smart Cities based on Software Defined Networks (SDNs) and Cyber-physical systems. Three layers comprise the proposed architecture.},

These important advancements have led to their adoption in the smart city model, which is used by many organizations for large cities around the world to significantly enhance and improve the quality of life of the inhabitants, improve the utilization of city resources, and reduce operational costs. However, in order to reach these important objectives, efficient networking and communication protocols are needed in order to provide the necessary coordination and control of the various system components.

The IoT becomes an instance of cyberphysical systems (CPSs) with the incorporation of sensors and actuators in IoT devices. Objects in the IoT have the potential to be grouped into geographical or logical clusters. Various IoT clusters generate huge amounts of data from diverse locations, which creates the need to process these data more efficiently.

abstract={Real-time information from embedded sources is hard to process if the number of sources is high. One typical example of this application area are car information systems where the cyber-physical system of a car connects to arbitrary sources in and outside of the car to deliver value-adding information to the driver of the car. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for such a car information system based on a smart data streaming infrastructure. This architecture has been implemented and we have run several experiments to examine the quality of our proposed solution. The current implementation is based on Spark Streaming, Couchbase and written in Scala. We have deployed our implementation on a distributed system using cloud services. This allows us to perform experiments with a high load as typical for the application scenario. First results from our experiments show that our proposed solution for a smart data based car information system is resilient to typical failures and scales for the described use-cases.},

pages={644-652}, 
abstract={Current research approaches within the area of logistics focus on smart objects and cyber physical systems to increase transparency and collect data for the optimization of processes. Due to the challenges of cross-company usage and missing standardization, special load carriers are mostly neglected, even though container loops are still lacking transparency. Problems that result from insufficient transparency in supply chains, e.g. for the automotive industry, including under-and overstocks or even the stop of production due to missing or damaged containers. To address this shortage of transparency, this paper presents an architectural design that allows the cross-company collection, analysis and provision of process-relevant data from smart and modular special load carriers within a supply chain. The containers are commensurately equipped with sensors and communication technologies to enable innovative financial, load-carrier-based and data-based services. Based on this architecture, a cloud-based service system can be implemented that enables data driven services along the supply chain for all participants to increase transparency of supply chain processes and raise optimization potentials. The proposed architectural design leaves room for further integration of smart objects along the supply chain and can easily be adapted for different scenarios.},

abstract={A trend in up-to-date developments in service computing focuses on the theme of dynamic composition and optimization of services and its application in service-oriented networked manufacturing (SONM). The paper addresses the particularities of manufacturing resource service composition and optimization (MRSCO) in SONM and proposes a conceptual framework. In this framework, cyber-physical systems (CPS) are incorporated into the manufacturing domain, together with the sensing model and cognitive model that are proposed herein, to integrate the offline resources with online services. Then the QoS models of component manufacturing resource services (MRS), basic constructs and composite MRS are formulated, with the consideration of coexistence of online and offline service phases. Based on the theory of receding horizon control approach and all the aforementioned models, a self-adaptive mechanism is designed in response to the dynamic QoS of MRS and variation of QoS goals, ultimately to guarantee the optimality of composite manufacturing service at runtime. Finally, a prototype platform is developed. The findings suggest constructive ways to model and evaluate MRS in dynamic MRSCO and to transit from a one-off optimization to the feedback-based, closed-loop adaptive MRSCO.},

abstract={Next-generation collaborative activities and missions will be carried out by autonomous groups of devices with a large variety of cognitive capabilities. These devices will have to operate in environments characterized by uncertainty, insecurity (both physical and cyber), and instability. In such environments, communications may be fragmented. Proper policy-based management of such autonomous device groups is thus critical. However current policy management systems have many limitations, including lack of flexibility. In this paper, we articulate novel architectural approaches addressing the requirements for the effective management of autonomous groups of devices and discuss the notion of generative policies - a novel paradigm that enhances the flexibility of policy-based approaches to management. In this paper, we also survey types of policy that are essential for managing device groups. Even though many such policy types exist in conventional settings, their use in our context poses novel challenges that we articulate in the paper. We also introduce a research roadmap discussing several research directions towards the development of a cognitive and flexible policy-based approach to the management of autonomous groups of devices for collaborative missions. Finally, as our proposed policy paradigm is data-intensive, we discuss the problem of supplying the data required for policy decisions in environments characterized by mobility, uncertainly, and fragmented communications.},

In this paper, we present our OSGibasedmiddleware that abstracts the deployment of servicebasedCPS software components on a distributed platformcomprising robots, actuators, sensors and the cloud. Moreover, our middleware provides specific support to develop componentsbased on artificial neural networks, a technique that recentlybecame very popular for sensor data analytics and robot control. We demonstrate a system where a robot takes actions based onthe input from sensors in its vicinity.},

abstract={Starting with the invention of the steam engine in the 18th century, the industrial revolutions formed an ecosystem of over 20 billion connected devices with unforeseeable influence to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Predictions are that, by 2020 the connectable assets will generate about 44 ZB of data, which pose interesting challenges related to privacy, connectivity, scalability and others. A current line of action is the development of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), which can be monitored and controlled by private clouds or edge systems. Our approach is to bring functionalities, such as analytics, as close to the devices as possible (denoted as Fog Computing) to reduce latency and enhance data privacy and communication robustness. As a starting point we're extending a standard-compliant Machine-To-Machine Communication (M2M) architecture with container based orchestration mechanisms to enable CPSs to be programmable, autonomous and to communicate peer-to-peer. As the main field of application we are considering in particular smart factory environments and Industrial Internet domains in general.},

abstract={Strong digitalization and shifting from unidirectional to bidirectional topology have transformed the electrical grid into a cyber-physical energy system, i.e. smart grid, with strong interdependency among various domains. It is mandatory to develop a comprehensive and holistic validation approach for such large scale system. However, a single research infrastructure may not have sufficient expertise and equipment for such test, without huge or eventually unfeasible investment. In this paper, we propose another adequate approach: connecting existing and established infrastructures with complementary specialization and facilities into a cross-infrastructure holistic experiment. The proposition enables testing of CPES assessment research in near real-world scenario without significant investment while efficiently exploiting the existing infrastructures. Hybrid cloud based architecture is considered as the support for such setup and the design of cross-infrastructure experiment is also covered.},

abstract={To meet the ever growing demands of Internet and cloud services, the data center industry is experiencing rapid expansion. Data centers consume billions of KWh electricity every year, and each can take hundreds of million dollars to build. Most data centers are conservatively provisioned and operated to achieve high reliability, resulting in wasted resources and high cost. In this talk, we take a cyber-physical system view of sensing and control data centers and discuss opportunities and our experiences. We have designed and deployed wireless environmental sensors to monitor heat distribution in server rooms and software-based services to estimate server power consumption. We build models that bridge the cyber dynamics of computing and physical dynamics of the facility. The findings are used to advance the way equipment are provisioned, loads are distributed, and systems are operated. Finally, I will discuss a few challenges for scaling into the future, with alternative energy sources and alternative data center architecture.},

abstract={Blockchain technologies can enable decentralized and trustful features for the Internet of Things (IoT). Although, existing blockchain based solutions to provide data integrity verification for semi-trusted data storages (e.g. cloud providers) cannot respect the time determinism required by Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Additionally, they cannot be applied to resource-constrained IoT devices. We propose an architecture that can take advantage of blockchain features to allow further integrity verification of data produced by IoT devices even in the realm of CPS. Our architecture is divided into three levels, each of them responsible for tasks compatible with their resources capabilities. The first level, composed of sensors, actuators, and gateways, introduces the concept of Proof-of-Trust (PoT), an energy-efficient, time-deterministic and secure communication based on the Trustful Space-Time Protocol (TSTP). Upper levels are responsible for data persistence and integrity verification in the Cloud. The work also comprises a performance evaluation of the critical path of data to demonstrate that the architecture respect time-bounded operations demanded by the sense-decide-actuate cycle of CPSs. The additional delay of 5.894us added by our architecture is negligible for a typical TSTP with IEEE 802.15.4 radios which has communication latencies in the order of hundreds of milisseconds in each hop.},

abstract={Cyber physical systems (CPSs) are rapidly developing, with increasing scale, complexity and heterogeneity. However, testing CPSs systematically to ensure that they operate with high reliability remains a big challenge. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize existing works and technologies systematically, with the aim of inspiring new inventions for more efficient CPS testing. Accordingly, this paper first investigated the advances in CPS testing methods from ten aspects, including different testing paradigms, technologies, and some non-functional testing methods (including security testing, robust testing, and fragility testing). Then, we further elaborate on the infrastructures of CPS testbeds from the perspectives of their architecture and the corresponding function analyses. Finally, challenges and future research directions are identified and discussed. It can be concluded that future CPS testing should focus more on the combination of different paradigms and technologies for multi-objective by integrating more emerging cutting-edge technologies such as Internet of things, big data, cloud computing and AI.},

abstract={The large size and complexity of the modern digital hardware impose great challenges to design and validation. Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and System-Level Description Languages (SLDLs) rely on sequential discrete event semantics. Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) has recently gained extensive attention for parallelizing these languages due to the ever-increasing complexity of embedded and cyber physical systems. However, PDES application has not yet reached acceptable maturity and pervasiveness for accelerating computer architecture problems. This is due to inherent complexity of hardware components that require using different advanced PDES techniques. In this paper, we look at the main problem from a radically different angle. First, we suppose there is only a single universal discrete event model of computation for simulation purely defined by distributed optimistic PDES, i.e., logical-process-based event scheduling worldview. Second, we construct a new parallel system-level simulation language called OSML for ESL. Third, we propose a unified Cloud-based CAD tool called Troodon to automatically parallelize existing hardware languages atop OSML. To the best of our knowledge, OSML is the first work on optimistic synchronization applied to hardware-specific SLDLs and hardware models at different levels of abstraction in ESL, which contain complex data structures by proposing a hybrid checkpointing scheme.},

pages={293-297}, 
abstract={Increasing numbers of Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) are outsourcing or hosting their services on different Cloud Service Providers (CSP). They are also using different security services from these CSPs such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems and anti-malware. Although for the SMEs the main purpose of using these security services is to protect their cyber assets, either physical or virtual, from security threats and compromises, a very useful and valuable by-product of these security services is the wealth of Cyber Threat Information (CTI) that is collected over time. However, a common problem faced by SMEs is that they lack the resources and expertise for monitoring, analysing and reacting to any security notifications, alerts or events generated by the security services they have subscribed to. An obvious solution to this problem is that the SMEs outsource this problem to a cloud based service as well, by sharing their CTI with this service and allowing it to analyse the information and generate actionable reports or patches. The more CTI obtained from different SMEs, the better the analysis result. In this paper, we try to address some of the privacy and confidentiality issues that arise as a result of different SMEs sharing their CTI with such a third party analysis service for the aggregate analysis scenario we just described. We present the design and architecture of our solution that aims to allow SMEs to perform policy-based sharing of CTI, while also offering them flexible privacy and confidentiality controls.},

abstract={Medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) have been appeared as a possible approach for detecting and mitigating human errors. In this context, a MCPS in which medical and non-medical devices are connected could promptly detect potential risky or wrong procedures that deviate from standardized approaches. In this work, such a paradigm has been expanded to prototypical diagnostic devices. A distributed platform of such instruments is proposed in order to avoid misdiagnosis: diagnostic instrument send data to a message-oriented middleware, thus allowing technicians and doctors to remotely access test-related information for further processing and for creating an historical database. A Broker has been used for collecting data and distribute them to cloud database and to users. Two of the most diffused protocols, i.e., MQTT and AMQP, have been considered. An experimental setup has been developed to verify performance; time-related metrics confirm that the proposed approach has an end-to-end delay on few hundreds of milliseconds even for geographical scale networks.},

abstract={Mobile cyber-physical systems (M-CPSs) are envisaged as an integral part of our digital future. Dependability of M-CPSs is subject to timely, reliable, and secure information exchange among M-CPS entities. Information exchange provisioning in such systems is conventionally built with sole reliance on wireless connectivity. The conventional approaches, however, fail to efficiently exploit dynamism and heterogeneity, and to incorporate computing/cooperation as alternative system-wide tools for information exchange. To address these issues, we approach M-CPSs dependability from the information exchange perspective and define dependable-exchange-of-information (DeX) indicating collective M-CPS capability of information exchange provisioning. We then propose a cloud-based architecture for DeX provisioning as a service to facilitate versatile development of dependable M-CPSs.},

abstract={The current emphasis on Internet of Things (IoT) across the globe highlights the extreme importance of sensor-based intelligent and ubiquitous systems which are collectively known as cyber-physical systems. It is envisaged that the technology will create a network of smart devices and things to an unprecedented extent, far outnumbering the number of devices connected in the Internet as we know today. This unprecedented number of interconnected smart devices is likely to generate an unforeseen volume of data of different types, ready for analysis. The smartness of the Intelligent Infrastructures will depend on effective execution of various analytical algorithms on this accumulated dataset which forms the crux of the IoT paradigm. As of now, researchers rely on cloud-based paradigms to analyse the data in a data-parallel fashion, where analyses take place in large data centres comprised of large number of servers. Apart from the servers, there is a huge pool of relatively unused pool of computing resources in form of smart devices in and around our homes, such as mobile phones, home energy gateways, play-stations etc., which we collectively call edge devices. It is our belief that this pool of resources, if used in the right manner, can contribute to a large extent to effective and successful analysis of the data-set generated by the ubiquitous sensors, leading to a proper realization of the Intelligent Infrastructure paradigm, and we call this approach ANGELS computing. In this paper, we describe a framework which allows remote execution of programs within mobile devices and thus can act as one of the building blocks for the IoT paradigm. This is effectively a work-in-progress and it is acknowledged that there will be further challenges in such a framework and we will attempt to solve them during our course of research.},

abstract={Cyber-Physical Energy System, due to its multi-domain nature, requires a holistic validation methodology, which may involve the integration of assets and expertise from various research infrastructures. In this paper, the integration of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition services to cross- infrastructure experiment is proposed. The method requires a high degree of interoperability among the participating partners and can be applied to extend the capacity as well as the degree of realism of advanced validation method such as co-simulation, remote hardware-in-the-loop or hybrid simulation. The proposed method is applied to a case study of multi-agent system based control for islanded microgrid where real devices from one platform is integrated to real-time simulation and control platform in a distanced infrastructure, in a holistic experimental implementation.},

abstract={The proposed work relates to the development of Big-Sensor-Cloud Infrastructure (BSCI) that enhances the usability and management of the physical sensor devices. Traditional sensor networks are manufactured in a proprietary, vendor-specific design, and cannot handle application switching dynamically at runtime due to the presence of monolithic kernel. Thus, the applications are inaccessible to the common people who do not own physical sensor devices. Recently, sensor-cloud infrastructure has been viewed as a substitute for traditional sensor networks. However, with the increasing growth in the velocity, variety, and variability of data, the management becomes a serious concern and difficulty. Thus, existing systems are not able to capture, analyze, and control the present data efficiently, in real-time. BSCI is a distributed framework for "Big" sensor-data storage, processing, virtualization, leveraging, and efficient remote management. The framework interfaces between the physical and cyber worlds, thereby acquiring real-time data from the physical WSNs into the cloud platform. This data are processed and delivered to the end-users as a simple service - Sensors-as-a-Service (Se-aaS). Multiple organizations with heterogeneous demand can be successfully served with Se-aaS. From a user-perspective, BSCI allows the naive users to envision the typical sensor devices as simple accessible services like electricity, and water.},

abstract={Modern large-scale computing systems (data centers, supercomputers, cloud and edge setups and high-end cyber-physical systems) employ heterogeneous architectures that consist of multicore CPUs, general-purpose many-core GPUs, and programmable FPGAs. The effective utilization of these architectures poses several challenges, among which a primary one is power consumption. Voltage reduction is one of the most efficient methods to reduce power consumption of a chip. With the galloping adoption of hardware accelerators (i.e., GPUs and FPGAs) in large datacenters and other large-scale computing infrastructures, a comprehensive evaluation of the safe voltage reduction levels for each different chip can be employed for efficient reduction of the total power. We present a survey of recent studies in voltage margins reduction at the system level for modern CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs. The pessimistic voltage guardbands inserted by the silicon vendors can be exploited in all devices for significant power savings. Voltage reduction can reach 12% in multicore CPUs, 20% in manycore GPUs and 39% in FPGAs.},

abstract={The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) has revolutionized the industrial sectors around the world. Industry 4.0, a digitalization endeavour by the government of Germany for the factories of the future, aims to create intelligent, self-organized, and self-optimized smart factories by combining the IoT, cloud computing and artificial intelligence together. Interoperability is one of the crucial aspects of Industry 4.0 which requires standardized information models and exchange mechanisms for heterogeneous platform integration. Despite the development of various industry standards, this still remains the biggest burden due to multiple protocols, technologies, and policies involved. A common understanding of data semantics can be helpful in mitigating such problem. This paper provides a detailed comparison between the modelling approaches of Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and Resource Description Framework (RDF) and its extension languages. The aim is to garner a common understanding between these two modelling frameworks in order to generate a standardized mapping between them for the purpose of interoperable industrial applications.},

abstract={The requirement and expanding needs of bridging the physical and cyber world promote the emergence of a new global internet-based information architecture, the Internet of Things. The main challenge in Internet of Things is how to make fast and accurate decisions based on multi-modal sensing data. In this paper, we put human into the process and formulate a closed-loop computing paradigm for IoT data and decision intelligence. We first propose a human-in-the-loop reference model, which extends the traditional cyber-physical interaction extended into a closed-loop process based on cyber, physical and human three factors. We defined the three-factor decision paradigm in the model. On the basis of the reference model, we analyze the feature requirement in the data intelligent process and summarize it as three key aspects: semantic, interactive and iterative. Further, we analyze several major challenges facing IoT data and decision intelligence from the perspective of data characteristics. We select and review the recent progress in three typical application domains and analyzed whether the current research has solved the target issues. According to the results of the review and analysis, the paper finally summarizes and addresses some key research directions in the future.},

abstract={Various trends such as mobility of devices, Cloud Computing, or Cyber-Physical Systems lead to a higher degree of distribution. These systems-of-systems need to be integrated. The integration of various subsystems still remains a challenge. Self-improvement within self-adaptive systems can help to shift integration tasks from the static design time to the runtime, which fits the dynamic needs of these systems. Thus, it can enable the integration of system parts at runtime. In this paper, we define self-improvement as an adaptation of an Autonomic Computing system's adaptation logic. We present an overview of approaches for self-improvement in the domains of Autonomic Computing and self-adaptive systems. Based on a taxonomy for self-adaptation, we compare the approaches and categorize them. The categorization shows that the approaches focus either on structural or parameter adaptation but seldomly combine both. Based on the categorization, we elaborate challenges, that need to be addressed by future approaches for offering self-improving system integration at runtime.},

Therefore, the main parts, such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) need to be flexible as well. However, today's PLCs are monolithic and distributed as a single deployable piece of software. In this paper we propose an architecture that uses containers to modularize real-time control applications, messaging for communication and a hardware abstraction layer to improve maintainability, re-usability and flexibility. Using a prototypical implementation of the architecture, we validate the feasibility of this approach through a benchmark.},

abstract={Recent security threats against cyber-physical critical power grid infrastructures have further distinguished the differences and complex interdependencies between optimal plant control and infrastructural safety topics. In this paper, we reflect upon few real-world scenarios and threats to understand how those two topics meet. We then propose a practical architectural solutions to address the corresponding concerns. As a first concrete step, we focus on networked industrial control systems in smart grid where several sensing-processing-actuation embedded nodes receive information, make control decisions, and carry out optimal actions. Traditionally, global safety maintenance, e.g., transient stability, is embedded into control and taken into account by the decision making modules. With recent cyber security-induced safety incidents, we believe that the safety-handling modules should also be considered as a part of global trusted computing base (attack surface) for security purposes. Generally, maximizing the system's overall security requires the designers to minimize its trusted computing base. Consequently, we argue that the traditional combined safety-control system architecture is not anymore the optimal design paradigm to follow given existing threats. Instead, we propose PLCLOUD, a new cloud-based safety-preserving architecture that places a minimal trusted safety verifier layer between the physical world and the cyber-based supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) infrastructure, specifically programmable logic controllers (PLCs). PLCLOUD's main objective is to take care of infrastructural safety and separate it from optimal plant control that SCADA is responsible for.},

abstract={The current global emphasis on “Internet of Things (IoT)” have highlighted the extreme importance of sensor-based intelligent and ubiquitous systems which are more commonly known as “cyber-physical systems.” The technology has the potential to create a network of smart devices and things to an extent that has never been envisaged before, far outnumbering the number of devices connected in the Internet as we know today. The sheer number of such connected ubiquitous devices is likely to give rise to a hitherto unforeseen volume of data of different types with a demand for execution of analytical algorithms over the data. On the success of these analytic processes will depend the actual “smartness” of the “Intelligent Infrastructures” which now form the crux of the IoT paradigm. We have seen the advent of cloud-based paradigms to analyse the data in a data-parallel fashion within large data centres which now form the basis of the “big-data” problem. But apart from the servers in the data centres, we potentially have a huge pool of compute resources if we think about the smart devices in and around our homes collectively, which remain relatively idle. In this paper, we present a proposal with some emulated experimental results where we claim that in an IoT framework, the smart devices such as mobile phones, home gateways etc. can be utilised for execution of dataparallel analytic jobs. This is effectively a work-in-progress and it is acknowledged that there will be further challenges for real devices. Future research will attempt to consider these challenges.},

abstract={A massive number of devices are expected to fulfill the missions of sensing, processing and control in cyber-physical IoT systems with new applications and connectivity requirements. In this context, scarce spectrum resources must accommodate high traffic volume with stringent requirements of low latency, high reliability, and energy efficiency. Conventional centralized network architectures may not be able to fulfill these requirements due to congestion in backhaul links. This article presents a novel design of an RDNA for IoT that leverages the latest advances of mobile devices (e.g., their capability to act as access points, storing and computing capabilities) to dynamically harvest unused resources and mitigate network congestion. However, traffic dynamics may compromise the availability of terminal access points and channels, and thus network connectivity. The proposed design embraces solutions at the physical, access, networking, application, and business layers to improve network robustness. The high density of mobile devices provides alternatives for close connectivity, reducing interference and latency, and thus increasing reliability and energy efficiency. Moreover, the computing capabilities of mobile devices project smartness onto the edge, which is desirable for autonomous and intelligent decision making. A case study is included to illustrate the performance of RDNA. Potential applications of this architecture in the context of IoT are outlined. Finally, some challenges for future research are presented.},

abstract={This paper outlines the base concepts, materials and methods used to develop an Industry 4.0 architecture focused on predictive maintenance, while relying on low-cost principles to be affordable by Small Manufacturing Enterprises. The result of this research work was a low-cost, easy-to-develop cyber-physical system architecture that measures the temperature and vibration variables of a machining process in a Haas CNC turning centre, while storing such data in the cloud where Recursive Partitioning and Regression Tree model technique is run for predicting the rejection of machined parts based on a quality threshold. Machining quality is predicted based on temperature and/or vibration machining data and evaluated against average surface roughness of each machined part, demonstrating promising predictive accuracy.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems and the Internet-of-Things are getting more and more traction in different application areas. Boosted by initiatives such as Industrie 4.0 in Germany or the Industrial Internet Consortium in the US, they are enablers for innovation in industrial automation. To provide the advanced flexibility in production envisioned for future automation systems, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), as one of their main building blocks, also need to become more flexible. However, the conservative nature of this domain prohibits changes in the controller architecture impacting the installed base. Currently there exist various approaches that evolve control architectures to the next level, but none of them address flexible function deployment at the same time with legacy support. In this paper, we present a an architecture for a multi-purpose controller that is inspired by the virtualization trend in cloud systems which moves from heavyweight virtual machines to lightweight containers solutions such as LXC or Docker. Our solution includes the support for multiple PLC execution engines and adds support for the emulation of legacy engines as well. We evaluate this architecture by executing performance measurements that analyze the impact of container technologies to the real-time aspects of PLC engines.},

abstract={For more than 40 years, military strategists and astro-politicians have studied evolutionary and revolutionary needs for the protection of commercial SATCOM. In light of many valid reasons to protect user access to jamming, interference, direction finding, interception, intrusion, physical attack and nuclear effects, it is also necessary to recognize information warfare threats and vulnerabilities, as well as collaborative and distributed means for commercial systems to assist government and military systems under attack. In an ever-expanding mobile wireless smart phone and M2M infrastructure, as well as in the integration of broadband transport services and cloud computing, protection and security are a shared responsibility and liability across both government and commercial sectors. Commercial narrowband machine-to-machine (M2M) highlights the ability to offer four core emerging network services which will be further defined in this document: (1) Out-of-Band C2 for critical or complex platforms. (2) Cyber inoculation during network attack (3) Non-internet critical thread extranet communications and social tool integration.

abstract={Due to the positive effects concerning comfort, economic and ecologic reasons, building automation systems are increasingly integrated into nowadays buildings. Furthermore the investigations in cyber physical systems and the internet of things blur the line between the originally separate systems and lead to smart buildings cooperatively operated together with non-building automation systems. The BaaS ITEA 2 research project has recognized the need of a reference architecture in order to operate today's buildings and their complex service landscapes through a semantic description of the most important concerns such as: services, data points, building automation lifecycle. In order to provide a proof of concept, a technically and physically easy to overview building and a measure for teaching and illustration of the application of the BaaS reference architecture, we have built and developed a small-scale model house evaluation platform for building automation systems. This paper reports on the fundamentals the model house is based on, the realized concepts, the hardware, the software and the realized scenarios to show the application of building automation scenarios on the small-scale model house evaluation platform.},

pages={5030-5045}, 
abstract={This paper introduces an analytical framework to investigate optimal design choices for the placement of virtual controllers along the cloud-to-things continuum. The main application scenarios include low-latency cyber-physical systems in which real-time control actions are required in response to the changes in states of an Internet of Things (IoT) node. In such cases, deploying controller software on a cloud server is often not tolerable due to delay from the network edge to the cloud. Hence, it is desirable to trade reliability with latency by moving controller logic closer to the network edge. Modeling the IoT node as a dynamical system that evolves linearly in time with quadratic penalty for state deviations, recursive expressions for the optimum control policy and the resulting minimum cost value are obtained by taking virtual fog controller reliability and response time latency into account. Our results indicate that latency is more critical than reliability in provisioning virtualized control services over fog endpoints, as it determines the swiftness of the fog control system as well as the timeliness of state measurements. Based on a drone trajectory tracking model, an extensive simulation study is also performed to illustrate the influence of reliability and latency on the control of autonomous vehicles over fog.},

abstract={Increasing population density in urban centers demands adequate provision of services and infrastructure to meet the needs of city inhabitants, encompassing residents, workers, and visitors. The utilization of information and communications technologies to achieve this objective presents an opportunity for the development of smart cities, where city management and citizens are given access to a wealth of real-time information about the urban environment upon which to base decisions, actions, and future planning. This paper presents a framework for the realization of smart cities through the Internet of Things (IoT). The framework encompasses the complete urban information system, from the sensory level and networking support structure through to data management and Cloud-based integration of respective systems and services, and forms a transformational part of the existing cyber-physical system. This IoT vision for a smart city is applied to a noise mapping case study to illustrate a new method for existing operations that can be adapted for the enhancement and delivery of important city services.},

abstract={In the era of Internet of Things and dynamically interconnected systems, real time data becomes a new industrial asset, used to create new opportunities for operations improvement and to increase industrial value through the capitalisation of immaterial assets. In the smart factory, big data acquisition, analysis and visualisation pave the way to the manufacturing servitization, defined as the strategic innovation of organisations capabilities and processes to shift from product offering to an integrated "product plus service" offering. According to this vision, interconnected physical systems are associated with a cyber twin, where innovative services for big data management should be provided. In this paper, we propose an interactive data exploration framework, that poses a service-oriented perspective on the smart factory. Large amounts of data are incrementally collected from physical systems, organized and analysed on the cloud and new services are provided to enable data exploration. Such services implement novel data summarisation techniques, based on clustering, to manage data abundance, and data relevance evaluation techniques, aimed to focus the attention on relevant data that is being explored. Services are based on a multi-dimensional model, that is suited for supporting the iterative and multi-step exploration of Big Data.},

abstract={This paper presents an innovative fog computing middleware for distributed cooperative data analytics (DCDA) in the Internet of Things (IoT). The existing IoT systems gather data in a central place (e.g., cloud) for post-processing and high-level situation awareness. Such a collecte-and-compute paradigm cannot sustain the exponential sensors and data growth - the communication bandwidth is limited by spectrum and cannot catch up the data growth rate. In addition, many critical cyber-physical applications demand time-sensitive decisions, and privacy concerns prefer to avoid data collection. Distributed cooperative data analytics for high-level situation awareness can avoid costly data collection and meet the time and privacy requirements, and has received much attention in the past several years. In this work, we propose a DCDA architecture and middleware to support flexible and scalable DCDA, and test and validate the proposed middleware in seismic and ambient noise imaging case studies. The evaluation results in a fog computing testbed demonstrate that the DCDA middleware allows scalable and fault-tolerant data analytics and is suitable for real-time situation awareness under the bandwidth and communication constraints.},

abstract={SIoT and FC are two stand-alone technological paradigms under the realm of the Future Internet. SIoT relies on the self-establishment and self-management of inter-thing social relationships, in order to guarantee scalability to large IoT networks composed of both human and non-human agents. FC extends cloud capabilities to the access network, in order to allow resource-poor IoT devices to support delay-sensitive applications. Motivated by these complementary features of the SIoT and FC models, in this article we propose their integration into the novel paradigm of the SoFT. Specifically, we provide the following three main contributions. After describing the SoFT paradigm, we discuss its introduction through a number of exemplary use cases. We describe the architecture and the main resource-management functions of the resulting virtualized SoFT technological platform. It merges the physical things at the IoT layer and their virtual clones at the Fog layer into a cyber-physical overlay network of social clones. As a proof-of-concept, we present the simulated performance of a small-scale SoFT prototype, and compare its energy-vs.-delay performance with the corresponding one of a state-of-the-art virtualization-free technological platform, which relies only on device-to-device (D2D) inter-thing communication.},

Other factors, such as the tight coupling between the cyber system and the physical world, the heterogeneity of IoT devices and IoT communication protocols, and the extremely large system scale, make it more challenging to secure IoT systems.

Meanwhile, differences still exist between IoT and IIoT, and hence IIoT has some specific security concerns mainly on protecting critical industry control systems.

abstract={Recently, cloud manufacturing (CMfg) has received a growing amount of attention among researchers in the manufacturing community. Cloud manufacturing is a customer-driven manufacturing model inspired by cloud computing. Its aim is to provide everything as a service. One of the main issues of CMfg is an interaction between the smart components on the smart factory for providing manufacturing as a service based on the cyber-physical system. This interaction and connection should provide trust between the provider and user. However, the current CMfg architecture developed based on a centralized structure, which brings centralization problems for service providers also trust based data sharing on the shop floor level. Also, shop floor level connection is not deeply study based on security problems. In this respect, we try to expend our previous concept of blockchain cloud manufacturing (BCMfg), in the shop floor level, we focused on machine level connection, and shop floor data sharing based on blockchain technology (BCT). Therefore, this paper used two type blockchain network; public and private for manufacturing service providers on the CMfg. The public BCN used for service provider level and private BCN used for shop level, which is connected to machine level for data receiving and gathering. The proposed architecture is explained and advantages are defined.},

abstract={Cloud based machine-to-machine (M2M) communications have emerged to achieve ubiquitous and autonomous data transportation for future daily life in the cyber-physical world. In light of the need of network characterizations, we analyze the connected M2M network in the machine swarm of geometric random graph topology, including degree distribution, network diameter, and average distance (i.e., hops). Without the need of end-to-end information to escape catastrophic complexity, information dissemination appears an effective way in machine swarm. To fully understand practical data transportation, G/G/1 queuing network model is exploited to obtain average end-to-end delay and maximum achievable system throughput. Furthermore, as real applications may require dependable networking performance across the swarm, quality of service (QoS) along with large network diameter creates a new intellectual challenge. We extend the concept of small-world network to form shortcuts among data aggregators as infrastructure-swarm two-tier heterogeneous network architecture, then leverage the statistical concept of network control instead of precise network optimization, to innovatively achieve QoS guarantees. Simulation results further confirm the proposed heterogeneous network architecture to effectively control delay guarantees in a statistical way and to facilitate a new design paradigm in reliable M2M communications.},

abstract={This article addresses one of the key challenges of engaging a massive ad hoc crowd by providing sustainable incentives. The incentive model is based on a context-aware cyber-physical spatio-temporal serious game with the help of a mobile crowd sensing mechanism. To this end, this article describes a framework that can create an ad hoc social network of millions of people and provide context-aware serious-game services as an incentive. While interacting with different services, the massive crowd shares a rich trail of geo-tagged multimedia data, which acts as a crowdsourcing eco-system. The incentive model has been tested on the mass crowd at the Hajj since 2014. From our observations, we conclude that the framework provides a sustainable incentive mechanism that can solve many real-life problems such as reaching a person in a crowd within the shortest possible time, isolating significant events, finding lost individuals, handling emergency situations, helping pilgrims to perform ritual events based on location and time, and sharing geo-tagged multimedia resources among a community of interest within the crowd. The framework allows an ad hoc social network to be formed within a very large crowd, a community of interests to be created for each person, and information to be shared with the right community of interests. We present the communication paradigm of the framework, the serious game incentive model, and cloud-based massive geo-tagged social network architecture.},

First, the concept of electrocardiogram is explained. Then, a problem statement based on manufacturing scenario is presented. Subsequently, the architecture of the proposed algorithm called integrated DDA and the algorithm workflow are provided. Moreover, DECG is compared with traditional factory information system, and the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are validated experimentally.

abstract={Deep learning is a state-of-the-art approach that provides highly accurate inference for many cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as autonomous cars and robots. Deep learning inference often needs to be performed locally on mobile and embedded devices, rather than in the cloud, to address concerns such as latency, power consumption, and limited bandwidth. However, existing approaches have focused on delivering “best-effort” performance to resource-constrained mobile embedded devices, resulting in unpredictable performance under highly variable environments of CPS. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning inference runtime, called DeepRT, that supports multiple QoS objectives simultaneously against unpredictable workloads. In DeepRT, the multiple inputs/multiple outputs (MIMO) modeling and control methodology is proposed as a primary tool to support multiple QoS goals including the inference latency and power consumption. DeepRT’s MIMO controller coordinates multiple computing resources, such as CPUs and GPUs, by capturing their close interactions and effects on multiple QoS objectives. We demonstrate the viability of DeepRT’s QoS management architecture by implementing a prototype of DeepRT. The evaluation results demonstrate that, compared with baseline approaches, DeepRT can support the desired inference latency as well as power consumption for various deep learning models in a highly robust manner.},

abstract={In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the ability of embedded devices, sensors, and actuators to communicate, and create a ubiquitous cyber-physical world. The growth of the notion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the rapid development of technologies such as short range mobile communication and improved energy-efficiency is expected to create a pervasive connection of “things.” This will inevitably result in the generation of enormous amount of data, which have to be stored, processed, and accessed. Cloud computing has long been recognized as a paradigm for big data storage and analytics. The combination of cloud computing and IoT can enable ubiquitous sensing services and powerful processing of sensing data streams beyond the capability of individual things, thus stimulating innovations in both fields. For example, cloud platforms allow the sensing data to be stored and used intelligently for smart monitoring and actuation with the smart devices. Novel data fusion algorithms, machine learning methods, and artificial intelligence techniques can be implemented and run centralized or distributed on the cloud to achieve automated decision making. These will boost the development of new applications, such as smart cities, grids, and transportation systems. New challenges, however, arise when IoT meets cloud—there is an urgent need for novel network architectures that seamlessly integrate them, and protocols that facilitate big data streaming from IoT to the cloud. QoS and QoE, as well as data security, privacy, and reliability, are critical concerns during the integration.},

pages={62-64}, 
abstract={Tubiquitous ultra-broadband network enabling the future Internet (FI), is not only about new releases of current network generations and services, but, more significantly, will be associated with a true revolution in the information and communications technologies (ICT) field: the network will efficiently and effectively take forward new-fangled services to everyone and everything, such as cognitive objects and cyber physical systems (CPSs). A "full immersive (3D) experience" enriched by "context information" and, in particular, "anything or everything as a service (XaaS)" are the main business drivers for massive adoption and market uptake of the new fundamental enabling technologies, beyond today's "client-server" model, where the network has been reduced to a ubiquitous "pipe of bits." XaaS refers to those services — beyond the current models of software as a service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and platfore as a service (PaaS), SPI models, of cloud computing — such as data as a service (DaaS), security as a service (again, SaaS), network as a service (NaaS), knowledge as a service (KaaS), machine as a service (MaaS), and robot as a service (RaaS), which could be delivered over the advanced 5G infrastructure, without the need to own hardware, software, or even the cognitive objects themselves. Communication services, such as voice and video telephony, will be enriched and bundled with other services. The network infrastructure is expected to become the "nervous system" of the actual digital society and digital economy. This challenge calls for a complete redesign of services and service capabilities, architectures, interfaces, functions, access and non-access stratum protocols and related procedures, as well as advanced algorithms (e.g., for unified connection, security, mobility and routing management, and reconfiguration of ICT services; and any type of resource of cyber physical systems). The expected transformation will be especially true at the edge, that is, around the end user (or prosumer), where the "intelligence" already started migrating a few years ago, and where massive processing, memory, and storage capacity are gradually accumulating.},

abstract={The papers in this special section focus on the intelligent Internet of things (IoT). The IoT is becoming an attractive paradigm to realize interactions among ubiquitous things in the physical, cyber, and social spaces. In the IoT, the ubiquitous things are assigned with the capability of comprehensive perception, reliable information transmission, and smart processing, in which intelligence becomes a significant feature and should be highlighted. The intelligent IoT enables distributed intelligent devices to play novel roles as smart data acquisition, advanced information extraction, self-adaptive control manipulation, reliable transmission, and intelligent decision support and services. The success of intelligent IoT highly depends on the system architectures, networks and communications, data processing and ubiquitous computing technologies, which support efficient and reliable physical and cyber interconnections. In addition to the handling of huge sensed data, physical infrastructures, interfaces/middleware, and application services are required to support intelligent management and other business-related activities, including clouding computing, big data, semantic web, knowledge coordination, and social computing. This issue includes innovative and significant research activities on the design, analysis, implementation, and evaluation of intelligent IoT and related supporting technologies.},

abstract={The concept of the MANTIS project is to provide a proactive maintenance service platform architecture based on Cyber Physical Systems that allows to estimate future performance, to predict and prevent imminent failures and to schedule proactive maintenance. Maintenance is an important function that creates additional value in the business process as well as new business models with a stronger service orientation. Physical systems and the environment they operate in are monitored continuously by a broad and diverse range of intelligent sensors, resulting in massive amounts of data that characterize the usage history, operational condition, location, movement and other physical properties of those systems. These systems form part of a larger network of heterogeneous and collaborative systems (e.g. vehicle fleets or photovoltaic parks) connected via robust communication mechanisms able to operate in challenging environments. MANTIS consists of distributed processing chains that efficiently transform raw data into knowledge while minimizing the need for bandwidth. Sophisticated distributed sensing and decision making functions are performed at different levels in a collaborative way, ranging from local nodes to locally optimize performance, bandwidth and maintenance; to cloud-based platforms that integrate information from diverse systems and execute distributed processing and analytics algorithms for global decision making. MANTIS will contribute to companies' assets availability, competitiveness, growth and sustainability.},
