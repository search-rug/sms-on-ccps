	Abstract = {Flexibility in mass-customized manufacturing can be supported significantly by the introduction of Cyber-Physical Production System and the connection of production modules to AI (artificial intelligence) Cloud services. Even though there exist standardized protocols from device to IT system, there are still challenges for the synchronization between cyber-model and physical object, and the application of decision making in the cyber-model. Although high performance machine learning services make the Cloud a preferred computation node, possible unstable connection with manufacturing resources enforce new service distribution approaches in the network. This paper proposes an Edge Computing architecture which is the mediator between machines, by providing local Cloud services with fast response time and preprocessing resources for a vast amount of data. As an illustrative example the selected Edge service pre-processes data form an augmented reality device in order to communicate with the cyber-model in real time. The Edge platform controls the computing resources and prioritizes all processes of Edge Services for a dynamic update of production lines and human-machine-interaction. {\copyright} Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	Abstract = {Network-embedded systems equipped with monitoring, computing and communication features, enable the development of custom applications suitable for today requirements. These are the components of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, characterized by functional and geographic decentralization. Traditional architectures through which data is collected include IoT devices that can transmit raw measurements values from a heterogeneous distributed network to a Cloud platform for high-level storage, analysis and processing. By improving the overall data distribution across the network, one can manage shortcomings generated by high latency and storage cost of the traditional Cloud Computing architecture. A particular use case for such implementation can be applied in the industrial environment. The new concept of Industry 4.0, an interplay of IoT and cyber-physical systems (CPS), is based, among others, on decentralized networks for data manipulation. Fog Computing can be synergistically coupled with the local control layer in a nonintrusive manner in order to provide performance information upload to the Cloud level. The article presents a framework architecture for data monitoring in an industrial environment. The data is used for predictive maintenance and performance KPIs (key performance indicators) concerning a flexible assembly line. {\copyright} 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In fact, Internet helps businesses to break down physical and technological limitations and establish global networks that incorporate their machinery, warehousing systems and production facilities in the shape of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). In the manufacturing environment, these CPS comprise smart machines, storage systems and production facilities capable of autonomously exchanging information, triggering actions and controlling each other independently thanks to Internet of Thing and Services (IoTS), Cloud Computing and Cognitive Computing capabilities. This paper will present a state of art of this technological evolution that can be described as new industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0.

	Abstract = {Trust is a crucial aspect when cyber-physical systems have to rely on resources and services under ownership of various entities, such as in the case of Edge, Fog and Cloud computing. The DECENTER's Fog Computing Platform is developed to support Big Data pipelines, which start from the Internet of Things (IoT), such as cameras that provide video-streams for subsequent analysis. It is used to implement Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms across the Edge-Fog-Cloud computing continuum which provide benefits to applications, including high Quality of Service (QoS), improved privacy and security, lower operational costs and similar. In this article, we present a trust management architecture for DECENTER that relies on the use of blockchain-based Smart Contracts (SCs) and specifically designed trustless Smart Oracles. The architecture is implemented on Ethereum ledger (testnet) and three trust management scenarios are used for illustration. The scenarios (trust management for cameras, trusted data flow and QoS based computing node selection) are used to present the benefits of establishing trust relationships among entities, services and stakeholders of the platform. {\copyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Smart manufacturing is the core in the 4th industrial revolution. Smart shop-floor is one of the basic units of smart manufacturing. With the development of the advanced technologies (e.g. cloud computing, internet of things, model-based definition, advanced simulation, artificial intelligence), a larger number of virtual shop-floors are being built. However, it is very important that how to realize the intelligent interconnection and interaction between physical shop-floors and virtual ones. Digital twin (DT) is one of the key technologies associated to the cyber-physical system. In this paper, we present our vision on the cyber-physical production system (CPPS) towards smart shop-floor at scale via DT. This paper firstly explores a product manufacturing digital twin (PMDT), which focuses on the production phase in smart shop-floor. The proposed PMDT consists of five models: Product Definition Model (PDM), Geometric and Shape Model (GSM), Manufacturing Attribute Model (MAM), Behavior and Rule Model (BRM) and Data Fusion Model (DFM). And then based on PMDT, this paper proposes a new architecture of CPPS, which is composed of five layers (physical layer, network layer, database layer, model layer, application layer). Finally, this paper addresses the opportunities to use DT for the CPPS to support job scheduling during normal operation. Furthermore, the related further work and suggestions are also discussed. {\copyright} 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	Abstract = {Industrial cyber-physical systems are the primary enabling technology for Industry 4.0, which combine legacy industrial and control engineering, with emerging technology paradigms (e.g. big data, internet-of-things, artificial intelligence, and machine learning), to derive self-aware and self-configuring factories capable of delivering major production innovations. However, the technologies and architectures needed to connect and extend physical factory operations to the cyber world have not been fully resolved. Although cloud computing and service-oriented architectures demonstrate strong adoption, such implementations are commonly produced using information technology perspectives, which can overlook engineering, control and Industry 4.0 design concerns relating to real-time performance, reliability or resilience. Hence, this research compares the latency and reliability performance of cyber-physical interfaces implemented using traditional cloud computing (i.e. centralised), and emerging fog computing (i.e. decentralised) paradigms, to deliver real-time embedded machine learning engineering applications for Industry 4.0. The findings highlight that despite the cloud's highly scalable processing capacity, the fog's decentralised, localised and autonomous topology may provide greater consistency, reliability, privacy and security for Industry 4.0 engineering applications, with the difference in observed maximum latency ranging from 67.7%--99.4%. In addition, communication failures rates highlighted differences in both consistency and reliability, with the fog interface successfully responding to 900,000 communication requests (i.e. 0% failure rate), and the cloud interface recording failure rates of 0.11%, 1.42%, and 6.6% under varying levels of stress. {\copyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Cloud computing is revolutionizing the backbone of data analysis applications, including industrial ones. One of its main pillars is the separation of the logic with which data is accessed (e.g., to study the efficiency of a manufacturing system) from the actual hardware (e.g., server) that maintains and analyses the data. Large distributed cyber-physical systems enabled by, among other technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), made nonetheless clear that 'what to do' with the data and 'where to do it' are not disjoint problems; i.e., cloud computing on its own is not enough. Fog and edge computing have emerged as complementary options, to distribute the analysis, helping with challenges by means of close-to-the-source data analysis.We show for a key problem for industrial processes, that of shifting bottleneck detection, how to take advantage of such multi-tier computing architectures, to perform continuous and configurable analysis of data from Manufacturing Execution Systems. We propose a processing framework, STRATUM, and an algorithm, AMBLE, for continuous, data stream processing. STRATUM seamlessly distributes and parallelizes the processing across the tiers and AMBLE guarantees consistent analysis in spite of timing fluctuations, which are commonly introduced due to e.g. the communication system; it also achieves efficiency through appropriate data structures for in-memory processing. The experimental study on a real-world dataset, taken from a production line over two years and including 8.5 million entries, shows the benefits of the proposed solution in enabling configurable and efficient analysis. {\copyright} 2019 IEEE.},

Industry 4.0, a digitalization endeavour by the government of Germany for the factories of the future, aims to create intelligent, self-organized, and self-optimized smart factories by combining the IoT, cloud computing and artificial intelligence together. Interoperability is one of the crucial aspects of Industry 4.0 which requires standardized information models and exchange mechanisms for heterogeneous platform integration. Despite the development of various industry standards, this still remains the biggest burden due to multiple protocols, technologies, and policies involved. A common understanding of data semantics can be helpful in mitigating such problem. This paper provides a detailed comparison between the modelling approaches of Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and Resource Description Framework (RDF) and its extension languages. The aim is to garner a common understanding between these two modelling frameworks in order to generate a standardized mapping between them for the purpose of interoperable industrial applications. {\copyright} 2019 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Research and development of applications for smart cities are extremely relevant considering the various problems that population growth will bring to large urban centers in the next few years. Although research on cyber-physical systems, cloud computing, embedded devices, sensor and actuator networks, and participatory sensing, among other paradigms, is driving the growth of solutions, there are a lot of challenges that need to be addressed. Based on these observations, in this work, we present an integrated system architecture for decision-making support and urban planning by introducing its building blocks (termed components): sensing/actuation, local processing, communication, cloud platform, and application components. In the sensing/actuation component, we present the major relevant resources for data collection, identification devices, and actuators that can be used in smart city solutions. Sensing/actuation component is followed by the local processing component, which is responsible for processing, decision-making support, and control in local scale. The communication component, as the connection element among all these components, is presented with an emphasis on the open-access metropolitan area network and cellular networks. The cloud platform is the essential component for urban planning and integration with electronic governance legacy systems, and finally, the application component, in which the government administrator and users have access to public management tools, citizen services, and other urban planning resources. {\copyright} The Author(s) 2019.},

	Abstract = {Modern large-scale computing systems (data centers, supercomputers, cloud and edge setups and high-end cyber-physical systems) employ heterogeneous architectures that consist of multicore CPUs, general-purpose many-core GPUs, and programmable FPGAs. The effective utilization of these architectures poses several challenges, among which a primary one is power consumption. Voltage reduction is one of the most efficient methods to reduce power consumption of a chip. With the galloping adoption of hardware accelerators (i.e., GPUs and FPGAs) in large datacenters and other large-scale computing infrastructures, a comprehensive evaluation of the safe voltage reduction levels for each different chip can be employed for efficient reduction of the total power. We present a survey of recent studies in voltage margins reduction at the system level for modern CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs. The pessimistic voltage guardbands inserted by the silicon vendors can be exploited in all devices for significant power savings. Voltage reduction can reach 12% in multicore CPUs, 20% in manycore GPUs and 39% in FPGAs. {\copyright} 2019 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {The pillars of Industry 4.0 require a modern smart factory to be integrated, store data into the Cloud, access the Cloud for data analytics and share information at software level for simulation and Hardware-In-the-Loop capabilities. The resulting Cyber-Physical System is often called Cyber-Physical Manufacturing System, and it becomes fundamental to cope with the increased system complexity and the desired performances. However, since a lot of old production systems are based on monolitic architectures, with limited external communication ports and reduced local computational capabilities, it is very difficult to make such production lines compliant to Industry 4.0 pillars. Wireless Sensor Network is a solution for the smart connection of a production line to a Cyber-Physical System architecture, data processing through Cloud Computing. The scope of this research work is to propose an intermediate layer within the architecture that allows each device, production line and machine to be independently connected despite the adopted protocol. The solution is based on OSGi Framework, which is able to seamlessly integrate both hardware and software wireless sensors, send data into the Cloud for further data analysis, and grant both Hardware-In-the-Loop and Cloud Computing capabilities. A general description of the architecture is here proposed, together with preliminary results on a real manufacturing line for data collection and analysis over a period of two months. {\copyright} 2019 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Lately, a DDoS attack paralyze Internet systems with access attacks and conquer the network itself. We need a solution to build a security enhancement system for cloud computing service.The proposed method uses the desktop PCs to enhance the information security for cloud service through two network separation to defend against cyber attacks. One is physical network separation using 2 PCs using hypervisor architecture, select the network using KVM(Keyboard, Video monitor, Mouse) switched controller to select the network. The other is logical network partition using one PC with two kind of OSs, but network is divided through virtualization. Though a DDoS attack occurs on the HOST PC2 of the external network, the CPU and memory for the internal HOST PC1 are not affected by DDoS attack. It is confirmed that the CPU and memory for the internal network and the external network are processed independently of each other. The results of HOST CPU usage and PC1 memory usage measured during DDoS attack on HOST's PC2 were measured low because they were not executed in normal network environment. The HOST PC2 malicious code infection caused HOST PC1 CPU usage and memory usage to be measured with low performance and HOST PC1 performance will not change. It can be seen that the CPU usage of PC2 increases rapidly when it is infected with malicious code of HOST PC2. It is confirmed that the internal and external network for the HOST PC operate independently of each other through CPU and memory overload test. The proposal system using network separation is a security enhancement system that can provide security information about cloud service of cloud computing environment for cyber attack. {\copyright} BEIESP.},

	Abstract = {The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is the future of the Internet, where everything will be connected. Studies have revealed that fog/edge computing-based services will play a major role in extending the cloud by carrying out intermediary services at the edge of the network. Fog/edge computing-based IoT's (FECIoT) distributed architecture enhances service provisioning along the Cloud-to-Things continuum, thereby making it suitable for mission-critical applications. Furthermore, the proximity of fog/edge devices to where the data is produced makes it stand-out in terms of resource allocation, service delivery, and privacy. From the business perspective, FECIoT will lead to a boom and spring up of small-to-medium-sized enterprises, thereby encouraging inclusion for all. To this end, we present a comprehensive survey on state-of-the-art IoT literature over the period 2008-2018 and propose the FECIoT framework which covers the enabling technologies, services, and open research issues. A tutorial approach is employed, progressing from basic to more advanced concepts within the IoT domain. Lastly, we show how FECIoT can be deployed in real-life cyber-physical systems, such as the intelligent transportation system, smart grid, smart health-care, smart homes, and smart environment. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

With the development of edge computing, it is possible to construct time-critical cyber-physical-human systems based on edge platforms which can process users requests locally and provide low-latency interaction for users effectively. In this paper, we present our work on designing and implementing an edge platform, named WiPi. To verify its effectiveness in building time-critical cyber physical-human systems, we use WiPi in building a system for human-in-the-loop control of an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) for online water quality monitoring. Experimental results show that the edge-enabled system can reduce the interaction delay between the device and the user by 54% at least, as compared with the cloud-centric system. {\copyright} 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	Abstract = {Cloud computing has revolutionised the conceptualisation of IT environments in most fields of the economy. Nevertheless, it still requires adequate pre-requisites both in the business strategy and the computational architecture to be adopted successfully and profitably. This is especially true in the context of manufacturing where production services are very sensitive with respect to their distribution and localisation within the boundaries of the computing constellation. The paper aims at clarifying the concept and the application of Fluid Computing in Cyber-Physical Productions Systems, connecting the idea of computational sedimentation to the novel Fluid Manufacturing Architecture (FMA). The FMA encompasses the computing layers of cloud, fog, edge and mist, and extends them with a new one called Dew. The Dew represents the entry point where manufacturing legacy devices are converted into network-able, embedded components for the distributed production scenarios of Industry 4.0. The application of the FMA in a pilot factory has been investigated. The preliminary results of an agent-based simulation case-study for collaborative manufacturing services within the FMA are finally presented. {\copyright} 2019, {\copyright} 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Compared with traditional CPS, Cloud can improve its performance, but Cloud failures occur occasionally. The existing cloud-based CPS architectures rely too much on the Cloud, ignoring the risk and problems caused by Cloud failures, thus making the reliability of CPS not guaranteed. In order to solve the risk and problems above, spare parts are involved based on the research of cloud-based CPS. An architecture of cloud-based CPS with spare parts is proposed and two solutions for spare parts are designed. Agricultural intelligent temperature control system is used as an example to model and simulate the proposed architecture and solutions using Simulink. The simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and solutions, which enhance the reliability of cloud-based CPS. {\copyright} 2019 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {�Abstract: Resource allocation in general terms is defined as the allocation of data or information stored as resources depending upon the demand. This corresponds to the infrastructure or the virtual architecture of the system on demand. Resource allocation in profound databases is very monotonous and becomes a `must consider' factor in order to avoid collateral harm to the present system. Cloud computing is a fusion network of sensors in remote locations to perpetuate different mode of functionalities like collecting, processing, integrating and storing data. This avoids the need for local server networks to perform the above-listed operations. Presently there are innumerable optimizing schemes and techniques depicted in the market specifically in relation to resource allocation in cloud data management. A lot of these algorithms or schemes has proved to be energy efficient and trouble free in the simulation environment. There has been a lot of research undergone to allocate resources and still, it exists as an emerging research platform. Thus the proposed scheme involves resource allocation assisted by the cloud computing techniques in a cyber-physical system. This is a unique hybrid between the cyber-physical system and cloud computing which can be optimal, scalable, and energy efficient at the same time. The simulation results succeeded to be far more efficient and faster than the existing proposals. The resource management speed and the time for execution are much better than the pre-existing systems as obtained from the simulation application and are charted out to show the deviations and irregularities in the current schemes. {\copyright} BEIESP.},

	Abstract = {Due to agile product development, production systems have to be flexible and adaptable to meet high quality standards and a high productivity. As a result, set-up processes has to be shorter and more resilient because of the increasing number of variants. To meet future requirements, the processes need to be self-adaptive and reconfigurable at any time. Nowadays, a shift of the automation pyramid to interconnected cyber physical systems can be observed as well as emerging technologies as cloud and edge computing are introduced to production systems. These technologies in combination with the Digital Shadow, which provides information about all production assets, open up potential for an adaptive process control and an overall life cycle data management. For this, the Digital Shadow has to be used not only for the aggregation of data, but also for pushing data back into the system and to control the process. As a result, services in regard to an architecture based on edge computing as an enabling technology for an adaptive production together with the Digital Shadow are presented, implemented and discussed on the basis of an industrial use case. {\copyright} 2019 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {The adoption of both Cyber--Physical Systems (CPSs) and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has enabled the evolution towards the so-called Industry 4.0. These technologies, together with cloud computing and artificial intelligence, foster new business opportunities. Besides, several industrial applications need immediate decision making and fog computing is emerging as a promising solution to address such requirement. In order to achieve a cost-efficient system, we propose taking advantage from spot instances, a new service offered by cloud providers, which provide resources at lower prices. The main downside of these instances is that they do not ensure service continuity and they might suffer from interruptions. An architecture that combines fog and multi-cloud deployments along with Network Coding (NC) techniques, guarantees the needed fault-tolerance for the cloud environment, and also reduces the required amount of redundant data to provide reliable services. In this paper we analyze how NC can actually help to reduce the storage cost and improve the resource efficiency for industrial applications, based on a multi-cloud infrastructure. The cost analysis has been carried out using both real AWS EC2 spot instance prices and, to complement them, prices obtained from a model based on a finite Markov chain, derived from real measurements. We have analyzed the overall system cost, depending on different parameters, showing that configurations that seek to minimize the storage yield a higher cost reduction, due to the strong impact of storage cost. {\copyright} 2019 by the authors.

High-order Bi-Lanczos method has emergedasapowerful tool serving asmulti-dimensional data processing, such as prevailing feature extraction, classification, and clustering of high-order data, in CPSSs. However, integrated edge-fog-cloud architecture is open and users have very limited control; how to carry out big data processing without compromising the security and privacy is a challenging issue in edge-fog-cloud-assisted smart applications. In this work, we propose a novel and practical privacy-preserving high-order Bi-Lanczos scheme in integrated edge-fog-cloud architectural paradigm for smart environments. More precisely, we first propose a privacy-preserving big data processing model using the synergy of edge, fog, and cloud. The proposed model enables edge, fog, and cloud to cooperatively complete big data processing without compromising users' privacy for large-scale tensor data in CPSSs. Subsequently, making use of the model, we present a privacy-preserving high-order Bi-Lanczos scheme. Finally, we theoretically and empirically analyze the security and efficiency of the proposed privacy-preserving high-order Bi-Lanczos scheme based on an intelligent surveillance system case study. And the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides a privacy-preserving and efficient way of computations in integrated edge-fog-cloud paradigm for smart environments. {\copyright} 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	Abstract = {Smart Cities combine advances in Internet of Things, Big Data, Social Networks, and Cloud Computing technologies with the demand for cyber--physical applications in areas of public interest, such as Health, Public Safety, and Mobility. The end goal is to leverage the use of city resources to improve the quality of life of its citizens. Achieving this goal, however, requires advanced support for the development and operation of applications in a complex and dynamic environment. Middleware platforms can provide an integrated infrastructure that enables solutions for smart cities by combining heterogeneous city devices and providing unified, high-level facilities for the development of applications and services. Although several smart city platforms have been proposed in the literature, there are still open research and development challenges related to their scalability, maintainability, interoperability, and reuse in the context of different cities, to name a few. Moreover, available platforms lack extensive scientific validation, which hinders a comparative analysis of their applicability. Aiming to close this gap, we propose InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-source, smart city platform that enables the collaborative development of large-scale systems, applications, and services for the cities of the future, contributing to turn them into truly smart cyber--physical environments. In this paper, we present the architecture of the InterSCity platform, followed by a comprehensive set of experiments that evaluate its scalability. The experiments were conducted using a smart city simulator to generate realistic workloads used to assess the platform in extreme conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that the platform can scale horizontally to handle the highly dynamic demands of a large smart city while maintaining low response times. The experiments also show the effectiveness of the technique used to generate synthetic workloads. {\copyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The approach uses sharing graphics processing unit (GPU) devices across the virtual machine.

Comparative research between created computing cloud and bare metal environments is conducted and reveals the efficiency of the proposed approach.

	Abstract = {Cloud computing is an information technology paradigm enabling companies to sell computing resources more dynamically. Software and hardware are now commodities leased on demand. Because computer systems leased from a cloud service provider, virtual machines, are typically connected to internet, they can host web services, which are frequently components of service oriented architectures (SOAs). Such architectures have recently been adopted in factory automation, as they allow systems to reach high levels of decentralization and loose-coupling. SOA-based Factory automation systems combine physical production equipment with web services that belong to the information processing (cyber) domain, and they are therefore highly cyber-physical. When some of the services are deployed on cloud resources, SOA-based factory automation systems can be classified cloud-based cyber-physical systems. Each service in such a system is typically able to perform rather simple, atomic operations, whereas achievement of complex goals requires that the services be composed to collaboratively carry out workflows. This article investigates the use of cloud resources in automatic service workflow composition. To facilitate the acquisition and utilization of cloud resources, a system of two specialized web services is proposed. The system includes a web service that dynamically deploys virtual machines to carry out planning processes, thereby exhibiting artificial intelligence. Finally, this paper demonstrates the integration of the system with a previously proposed semantic web service composition framework. {\copyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	Abstract = {A Cyber-Physical Social System (CPSS) tightly integrates computer systems with the physical world and human activities. In this article, a three-level CPSS for early fire detection is presented to assist public authorities to promptly identify and act on emergency situations. At the bottom level, the system's architecture involves IoT nodes enabled with sensing and forest monitoring capabilities. Additionally, in this level, the crowd sensing paradigm is exploited to aggregate environmental information collected by end user devices present in the area of interest. Since the IoT nodes suffer from limited computational energy resources, an Edge Computing Infrastructure, at the middle level, facilitates the offloaded data processing regarding possible fire incidents. At the top level, a decision-making service deployed on Cloud nodes integrates data from various sources, including users' information on social media, and evaluates the situation criticality. In our work, a dynamic resource scaling mechanism for the Edge Computing Infrastructure is designed to address the demanding Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of this IoT-enabled time and mission critical application. The experimental results indicate that the vertical and horizontal scaling on the Edge Computing layer is beneficial for both the performance and the energy consumption of the IoT nodes. {\copyright} 2019 by the authors.

Through the CPPS, it is the reality of a smart factory to move physical factories to a digital based Cyber world and to monitor and control them intelligently and autonomously. However, the existing CPPS architectures present only an abstract modeling architecture, and the application of the OPC UA (Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture) Framework, which is the international standard for data exchange in smart factories, as the basic system of CPPS . In addition, the construction of CPPS using the cloud is still in its infancy, and a cloud platform accompanied by Edge Computing is needed considering the real-time, unstructured and distributed control of factories. In this paper, we propose an architecture that implements CPPS in the cloud with a cloud CPPS architecture applicable to real factories for smart factories, distributed control using Edge Computing with Container Docker, and an architecture that provides fault tolerance through load balancing and clustering using Edge Orchestration.

	Abstract = {Cloud and Fog computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for the Internet of things (IoT) and cyber--physical systems (CPS). One characteristic of CPS is the reciprocal feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements (computation, software and networking), which implies that data stream analytics is one of the core components of CPS. The reasons for this are: (i) it extracts the insights and the knowledge from the data streams generated by various sensors and other monitoring components embedded in the physical systems; (ii) it supports informed decision making; (iii) it enables feedback from the physical processes to the cyber counterparts; (iv) it eventually facilitates the integration of cyber and physical systems. There have been many successful applications of data streams analytics, powered by machine learning techniques, to CPS systems. Thus, it is necessary to have a survey on the particularities of the application of machine learning techniques to the CPS domain. In particular, we explore how machine learning methods should be deployed and integrated in Cloud and Fog architectures for better fulfilment of the requirements of mission criticality and time criticality arising in CPS domains. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to systematically study machine learning techniques for CPS data stream analytics from various perspectives, especially from a perspective that leads to the discussion and guidance of how the CPS machine learning methods should be deployed in a Cloud and Fog architecture. {\copyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Presently, many companies are transforming their strategy and product base, as well as their culture, processes and information systems to become more digital or to approach for a digital leadership. In the last years new business opportunities appeared using the potential of the Internet and related digital technologies, like Internet of Things, services computing, cloud computing, edge and fog computing, social networks, big data with analytics, mobile systems, collaboration networks, and cyber physical systems. Digitization fosters the development of IT environments with many rather small and distributed structures, like the Internet of Things, Microservices, or other micro-granular elements. This has a strong impact for architecting digital services and products. The change from a closed-world modeling perspective to more flexible open-world composition and evolution of micro-granular system architectures defines the moving context for adaptable systems. We are focusing on a continuous bottom-up integration of micro-granular architectures for a huge amount of dynamically growing systems and services, as part of a new digital enterprise architecture for service-dominant digital products. {\copyright} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	Abstract = {Softwarisation approaches in networks, storage systems, and smart devices aim to optimise costs and processes and bring new infrastructure definitions and functional values. A recent integration of wireless and mobile cyber-physical systems, with dramatically growing smart sensors, enable new types of pervasive smart and mobile urban surveillance infrastructures that open up new opportunities for boosting the accuracy, efficiency, and productivity of uninterrupted target tracking and situational awareness. Wireless sensors provide the tool for communications and security applications. They offer low-power, multi-functioning and computational capabilities. In this paper, we present a design and prototype of an efficient and effective fog system using light-weight agile software-defined control for mobile wireless nodes. Fog computing or edge computing, a recently proposed extension and complement for cloud computing, enables computing at the network edge in a smart device without outsourcing jobs to a remote cloud. We investigate an effective softwarisation approach in the Fog environment for dynamic big data driven, real-time urban surveillance tasks of uninterrupted target tracking. We address key technical challenges of node mobility to improve the system awareness. We built a preliminary proof-of-concept Light-weight controller architecture on both Android-and Linux-based smart devices and tested various collaborative scenarios among the mobile nodes. {\copyright} 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	Abstract = {The industrial cyber-physical system enables collaboration between distributed nodes across industrial clouds and edge devices. Flexibility and interoperability could be enhanced significantly by introducing the service-oriented architecture to industrial edge devices. From the industrial edge computing perspective, software components shall be dynamically composed across heterogeneous edge devices to perform various functionalities. In this paper, a knowledge-driven Microservice-based architecture to enable plug-and-play software components is proposed for industrial edges. These software components can be dynamically configured based on the orchestration of microservices with the support of the knowledge base and the reasoning process. These semantically enhanced plug-and-play microservices could provide rapid online reconfiguration without any programming efforts. The use of the plug-and-play software components is demonstrated by an assembly line example. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Since the introduction of the concept of cloud manufacturing in 2010, research on it has been ongoing for more than eight years, and much progress has been made. However, existing research indicates that people lack common and comprehensive understandings of some of the key issues with cloud manufacturing such as the concept, operation model, service mode, technology system, architecture, and essential characteristics. Moreover, few studies discuss in depth the relationships between cloud manufacturing and some closely related concepts such as cloud computing-based manufacturing, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), smart manufacturing, Industry 4.0, and Industrial Internet. Knowledge as a core supporting factor in cloud manufacturing has rarely been discussed systematically. Also, so far there has been no standardised definition for cloud manufacturing yet. All these are key issues to be further discussed and analysed in cloud manufacturing. In order to clarify the issues above and provide reference for future research and implementation, this paper conducts a comprehensive, systematic, and in-depth discussion and analysis of the aforementioned issues in cloud manufacturing and presents an alternative definition for cloud manufacturing based on the analysis of 12 existing definitions. Future perspectives of cloud manufacturing are also discussed with respect to both academic research and industrial implementation. {\copyright} 2019, {\copyright} 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	Abstract = {Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems have benefitted substantially from the introduction of a range of technology enablers. These include web-based and semantic computing, ubiquitous sensing, internet of things (IoT) with multi-connectivity, advanced computing architectures and digital platforms, coupled with edge or cloud side data management and analytics, and have contributed to shaping up enhanced or new data value chains in manufacturing. While parts of such data flows are increasingly automated, there is now a greater demand for more effectively integrating, rather than eliminating, human cognitive capabilities in the loop of production related processes. Human integration in Cyber-Physical environments can already be digitally supported in various ways. However, incorporating human skills and tangible knowledge requires approaches and technological solutions that facilitate the engagement of personnel within technical systems in ways that take advantage or amplify their cognitive capabilities to achieve more effective sociotechnical systems. After analysing related research, this paper introduces a novel viewpoint for enabling human in the loop engagement linked to cognitive capabilities and highlighting the role of context information management in industrial systems. Furthermore, it presents examples of technology enablers for placing the human in the loop at selected application cases relevant to production environments. Such placement benefits from the joint management of linked maintenance data and knowledge, expands the power of machine learning for asset awareness with embedded event detection, and facilitates IoT-driven analytics for product lifecycle management. {\copyright} 2019 The Authors},

@article{Kang20193778,
	Abstract = {Deep learning is a state-of-the-art approach that provides highly accurate inference for many cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as autonomous cars and robots. Deep learning inference often needs to be performed locally on mobile and embedded devices, rather than in the cloud, to address concerns such as latency, power consumption, and limited bandwidth. However, existing approaches have focused on delivering 'best-effort' performance to resource-constrained mobile embedded devices, resulting in unpredictable performance under highly variable environments of CPS. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning inference runtime, called DeepRT, that supports multiple QoS objectives simultaneously against unpredictable workloads. In DeepRT, the multiple inputs/multiple outputs (MIMO) modeling and control methodology is proposed as a primary tool to support multiple QoS goals including the inference latency and power consumption. DeepRT's MIMO controller coordinates multiple computing resources, such as CPUs and GPUs, by capturing their close interactions and effects on multiple QoS objectives. We demonstrate the viability of DeepRT's QoS management architecture by implementing a prototype of DeepRT. The evaluation results demonstrate that, compared with baseline approaches, DeepRT can support the desired inference latency as well as power consumption for various deep learning models in a highly robust manner. {\copyright} 2018 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Virtualization (NV) are emerged paradigms that simplified the control and management of the next generation networks, most importantly, Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, and Cyber-Physical Systems. The Internet of Things (IoT) includes a diverse range of a vast collection of heterogeneous devices that require interoperable communication, scalable platforms, and security provisioning. Security provisioning to an SDN-based IoT network poses a real security challenge leading to various serious security threats due to the connection of various heterogeneous devices having a wide range of access protocols. Furthermore, the logical centralized controlled intelligence of the SDN architecture represents a plethora of security challenges due to its single point of failure. It may throw the entire network into chaos and thus expose it to various known and unknown security threats and attacks. Security of SDN controlled IoT environment is still in infancy and thus remains the prime research agenda for both the industry and academia. This paper comprehensively reviews the current state-of-the-art security threats, vulnerabilities, and issues at the control plane. Moreover, this paper contributes by presenting a detailed classification of various security attacks on the control layer. A comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the latest mitigation techniques for various security breaches is also presented. Finally, this paper presents future research directions and challenges for further investigation down the line. {\copyright} 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {In the cyber-physic power system (CPPS) scenario, an increasing number of new devices, such as large-scale electric meters, embedded controllers and powerful computing devices are introduced into the power system. However, the architecture of present power system limits the seamless integration of the information system and physical systems. In this paper, a decentralized CPPS-fog architecture is proposed to address this issue. The proposed architecture distributes computing, communication storage, and control these services to the edge network along the cloud-to-thing continuum while the latter is commonly used in the smart grid. By applying the new architecture to the power system, the intelligence resources of the power system are effectively allocated to the parts closer to end users. Moreover, the realtime monitoring, on-line simulation, information integration, large-scale distributed control, and information security protection are easily achieved. The feasibility and advantages of the CPPS-fog architecture are demonstrated by the application in an island micro CPPS grid project. {\copyright} 2018 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Mobile edge cloud is emerging as a promising technology to internet of things and cyber physical system applications such as smart home and intelligent video surveillance. In smart home, various sensors are deployed to monitor the home environment and physiological health of individuals. The data collected by sensors are sent to an application, where numerous algorithms for emotion and sentiment detection, activity recognition and situation management are applied to provide healthcare- and emergency-related services and to manage resources at the home. The executions of these algorithms require a vast amount of computing and storage resources. To address the issue, the conventional approach is to send the collected data to an application on an internet cloud. This approach has several problems such as high communication latency, communication energy consumption and unnecessary data traffic to the core network. To overcome the drawbacks of the conventional cloud-based approach, a new system called mobile edge cloud is proposed. In mobile edge cloud, multiple mobile and stationary devices interconnected through wireless local area networks are combined to create a small cloud infrastructure at a local physical area such as home. Compared to traditional mobile distributed computing systems, mobile edge cloud introduces several complex challenges due to the heterogeneous computing environment, heterogeneous and dynamic network environment, node mobility, and limited battery power. The real time requirements associated with internet of things and cyber physical system applications make the problem even more challenging. In this paper, we describe the applications and challenges associated with design and development of mobile edge cloud system and propose an architecture based on a cross layer design approach for effective decision making. {\copyright} 2017 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {The diversity of power sources for electricity generation excites the current smart grid to evolve towards Cyber-Physical Energy System (CPES), which integrates with other systems, such as natural gas and heat. By advanced communication technologies, CPES can achieve effective energy fusion, real-time computation and precise control. With the increasing number of energy applications that bring large quantities of data, it calls for sufficient computing and storage resources with fast transmission and powerful processing to satisfy users' service level agreements (SLAs). This paper presents a multi-layered distributed cloud network (MDC) for CPES, with the design of the physical integration of energy systems, a distributed cloud architecture and a hierarchal information structure based on the fifth generation (5G). Furthermore, we present a two-level resource allocation model for cloud network, which aims to decide the location of deploying cloud facilities and dynamically adjust the number of virtual machines (VMs) to deal with the demand variation. We also simplify the model to only one level utilizing scalarization. The simulation shows the proposed model performs effectively compared to centralized solutions. {\copyright} 2018 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Service-oriented architecture (SOA) has emerged as a dominant architecture for interoperability between applications, by using a weakly coupled model based on the flexibility provided by web services, which has led to a wide range of applications, which is known as cloud computing. On the other hand, multi-agent system (MAS) is widely used in the industry, because it provides an appropriate solution to complex problems, in a proactive and intelligent way. Specifically, intelligent environments (smart city, smart classroom, cyber-physical system, and smart factory) obtain great benefits by using both architectures, because MAS endows intelligence to the environment, while SOA enables users to interact with cloud services, which improve the capabilities of the devices deployed in the environment. Additionally, the fog computing paradigm extends the cloud computing paradigm to be closer to the things that produce and act on the intelligent environment, allowing to deal with issues like mobility, real time, low latency, geo-localization, among other aspects. In this sense, in this article we present a middleware, which not only is capable of allowing MAS and SOA to communicate in a bidirectional and transparent way, but also it uses the fog computing paradigm autonomously, according to the context and to the system load factor. Additionally, we analyze the performance of the incorporation of the fog computing paradigm in our middleware and compare it with other works. {\copyright} 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	Abstract = {During the last years, the convergence of classical automation and modern information technology within cyber--physical production systems is an ongoing process. With this development, service-oriented architectures and technologies of Fog/edge and Cloud computing are now moving into the next generations of production systems. However, these innovations also create new challenges in terms of complexity and fragility. In order to ensure reliable production operation, it is necessary to adapt to any disruptions and disturbances caused by system-internal or external events. This leads to a dynamic reconfiguration of both, the operational technology and the services including the dependent information technology. The goal of this paper is to provide a system- and process-independent method for the dynamic evaluation, embedment and placement of services on the processing IT resources of a cyber--physical production system during operation. For this purpose, both production- and IT-specific requirements and properties of all resource elements involved are mapped in a unified formal system description. This includes the individual process steps as part of process control, the necessary services and their dependencies as well as the processing IT resources such as computing nodes and transmission links in the field, Fog/edge and Cloud. For the evaluation and comparison of different combinations, a suitable multi-criteria evaluation metric is defined and used for resource configuration. The unified modeling and evaluation of process steps and services enables a dynamic embedment of the most suitable available services for each individual process step. In addition, modeling and evaluating of services and processing IT resources enables services to be dynamically placed on the most appropriate IT resources. The result is a system of service embedments and placements in a heterogeneous system landscape that adapts dynamically to production- and IT-specific events. The validation of the approach is based on a case study in which dynamic changes of a process engineering production process are examined and discussed. This shows how the reliability of production in dynamically changing system landscapes can be increased. {\copyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Accordingly, this paper first investigated the advances in CPS testing methods from ten aspects, including different testing paradigms, technologies, and some non-functional testing methods (including security testing, robust testing, and fragility testing). Then, we further elaborate on the infrastructures of CPS testbeds from the perspectives of their architecture and the corresponding function analyses. Finally, challenges and future research directions are identified and discussed. It can be concluded that future CPS testing should focus more on the combination of different paradigms and technologies for multi-objective by integrating more emerging cutting-edge technologies such as Internet of things, big data, cloud computing, and AI. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Cloud computing is revolutionizing IT environments in most fields of economy. Its service-based approach enables collaboration and data exchange on higher level, with better efficiency and parallel decreasing costs. Also manufacturing environments can benefit from cloud technology and better fulfill fast changes in market demands, by applying diverse cloud deployment models and by virtualizing manufacturing processes and assets into services. As cloud becomes the basis of most innovative manufacturing IT systems, its future role in Cyber-physical Production Systems has to be properly investigated, as their interoperability will play a role of vital importance. In this paper, after a brief introduction to cloud criticality and cloud-based manufacturing, the mutual conceptual similarities in modelling distributed industrial services of two of the major standardization frameworks for industrial Internet architectures are presented: the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture (IIRA) and the Reference Architectural Model Industrie (RAMI 4.0). It is also introduced how their integration feasibility finds a strong affinity in specifications of the Open Connectivity Unified Architecture, a service-oriented architecture candidate to the standardization of Industrial Internet of Things based manufacturing platforms. Finally, the preliminary architecture of a prototype Smart Factory is presented as a case study. {\copyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {The ever-increasing number of IoT applications and cyber--physical services is introducing significant challenges associated to their cyber-security. Due to the constrained nature of the involved devices, some heavier computational tasks, such as deep traffic inspection and classification, essential for implementing automatic attack detection systems, are moved on specialized ``edge'' devices, in order to distribute the processing intelligence near to the data sources. These edge devices are mainly capable of effectively running pre-built classification models but have not enough storage and processing capabilities to build and upgrade such models from huge volumes of field training data, imposing a serious barrier to the deployment of such solutions. This work leverages the flexibility of cloud-based architectures, together with the recent advancements in the area of large-scale machine learning for shifting the more computationally-expensive and storage-demanding operations to the cloud in order to benefit of edge computing capabilities only for effectively performing traffic classification based on sophisticated Extreme Learning Machines models that are pre-built over the cloud. {\copyright} 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {Edge computing is the concept of moving computation back to the endpoints of a network, as an alternative to, or in combination with, centralized, cloud-based architectures. It is especially of interest for Internet-of-Things and Cyber-Physical Systems where embedded endpoints make up the edge of the network, and where these devices need to make localised, time-critical decisions. In these environment secure, ad-hoc device-to-device interaction is important, but offers a challenge because devices might belong to different systems, or security domains, which complicates trusted communication and key establishment. There has been a growing interest in complementing conventional cryptography with physical context. This allows for services that are difficult to achieve with existing cryptographic mechanisms: devices pairing (initial key establishment) and proof-of-proximity (ensuring devices are physically present). Numerous methods, the majority of which are based on the physical context of device characteristics, behavior or environment, have been proposed to supplement cryptography in achieving these services. This paper provides an overview of this area of research, first discussing the nature and importance of the two specified security services in ad-hoc communication settings and then providing an introduction to prominent physical context security approaches in literature. {\copyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Inter-connection and intelligence are the fundamental characteristics of CNC machine tools in this era. To make CNC machine tools be more accessible and promote them to a higher level of intelligence, this paper presents a new architecture of CNC machine tools based on a cyber-physical system and fog computing, named as a fog computing-based cyber-physical machine tool system (FC-CPMTS). The definition, functions, and hierarchical structure of the FC-CPMTS are described respectively. CNC machine tools, cyber space, and human beings are connected closely through sensing, computing, communicating, and controlling in the FC-CPMTS. The application of fog computing enhances autonomy and collaboration of CNC machine tools. It also reduces network traffic and calculation workload of the cloud platform in the FC-CPMTS. To demonstrate the rationality and feasibility of the FC-CPMTS, an FC-CPMTS for a heavy-duty CNC machine tool is taken as a case study. The result shows that autonomy, intelligence, interconnection, and interoperability of the CNC machine tool are improved. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Optimized water management strategies are among the most crucial concerns in a biomass power plant. Especially during the times of water scarcity, an improper water supply planning and operation result in a detrimental power generation or shut down processes. This paper aims to propose the cyber-physical cloud computing (CPCC), a mechanism of analysis and control physical process using cloud-based framework, in order to improve the efficiency of water management system in a biomass power plant. In this study, a 9.9 MW biomass power plant is implemented to investigate the performance of CPCC. The architecture of the proposed system consists of three physical tiers. The first tier is a tier of physical devices included with pressure, flow, pH sensors, water pumps and valves that are responsible for detecting the physical data and interacting with the water production process. The second tier is an edge computing device which functions as a controller, embedded server, data storage, gateway and switch to manage all operational tasks in an intranet area. The third tier is a cloud computing system which enables big data applications such as online monitoring and visualization of process operation, adaptive filtration fouling control, consuming water and total water cost analysis. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed system as the ability of an adaptive fouling control system to adjust backwash scheduling and chemical dosing so that achieving the target of purified water quality even during the fluctuation of raw water qualities. Subsequently, the water treatment system can achieve the capability for optimal total water cost operations under a target permeate flow rate and the percent of the recovery. Significantly, the data analytics in the CPCC reflect current operational requirements of water under local climate conditions, likewise contribute to the practical solution for sustainable water resource planning in the energy production. {\copyright} 2018, Intelligent Network and Systems Society.},

	Abstract = {In distributed digitalized environments in the context of the Internet of Things, we often need to do an analysis of big data originating at high rate-sensors at the edge of the infrastructure. A characteristic example is the light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology, that allows sensing surrounding objects with fine-grained resolution in large areas. Their data (known as point clouds), generated continuously at very high rates, through appropriate analysis can provide information to support automated functionality in distributed cyber-physical? systems; clustering of point clouds is a key problem to extract this type of information. Methods for solving the problem in a continuous fashion can facilitate improved processing in fog architectures, through enabling low-latency, efficient continuous and streaming processing of data close to the sources; moreover, parallelism is a key requirement to exploit a variety of computing architectures in this context. We proposeLisco, a single-pass continuous Euclidean-distance-based clustering of LiDAR point clouds, that maximizes the granularity of the data processing pipeline and thus shows the potential for data-and pipeline-parallelism. We further present its parallel version, P-Lisco, that is architecture-independent and exploits the parallelism revealed byLisco'salgorithmic approach. Besides their algorithmic analysis, we provide a thorough experimental evaluation on architectures representative of high-end servers and of resource-constrained embedded devices and highlight the multiplicative improvements and scalability benefits of the proposed algorithms compared to the baseline, using both real-world datasets as well as synthetic ones to fully explore a wide spectrum of stress-levels for the algorithms. {\copyright} 2018 IEEE.},

The proposed architecture allows to share process monitoring tasks between different resources, which can be geographically dislocated and managed by actors with different competences and functions. Distributed resources with enhanced computation and data storage capability allow to improve the efficiency of tool condition diagnosis and enable more robust decision-making, exploiting large information and knowledge sharing. Diagnosis on tool conditions is offered as a cloud service, using an architecture where the computing resources in the cloud are connected to the physical manufacturing system realising a complex cyber-physical system using sensor and network communication. Based on sensorial data acquired at the factory level, smart online diagnosis on consumed tool life and tool breakage occurrence is carried out through knowledge-based algorithms and cognitive pattern recognition paradigms. On the basis of the cloud diagnosis, the local server activates the proper corrective action to be taken, such as tool replacement, process halting or parameters change, sending the right command to the machine tool control. {\copyright} 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	Abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are a network of interacting physical and computer based sub-systems designed to improve the overall performance of complex systems by automatic operation, i.e., they are hierarchical, distributed (networked) control systems capable of generic 'self-' properties, such as self-optimization to reduce the effects of disturbance and for adaptation to changing environment, self-configuration for manageability and resilience, etc. Currently, the target application area for CPS are autonomous vehicles, smart infrastructure like smart cities, and Industry 4.0. It is clearly visible that these application areas will be served by a large number of more or less integrated but individual applications, sharing infrastructure using a distributed architecture including networking, edge computing nodes, sensors and actuators. The trend will be similar that was observed in generic server infrastructure in the IT field. Some years ago IT services were assigned to individual server computers (mail server, WEB server) resulting in complex maintenance and low reliability. However, services run in private or public Cloud infrastructures today, where they are assigned to server machines in a dynamical and automatic way reducing maintenance while improving reliability. For the same reason, without resource sharing in the CPS applications we cannot implement them effectively due to various resource limits. For example, factory floors are overwhelmed by new devices and networks installed for various new individual applications observing and controlling production in an ever increasing detail, which applications must be also integrated in to the company IT systems for data sharing, supervision, etc. following the Industry 4.0 trend. Developers, installers and maintainers cannot keep up with the needs, and complexity grows in an intractable pace. The situation is similar to the state of the IT industry 15-20 years ago, and the question arises that we can follow the solution of the IT industry, namely, virtualization of the infrastructure for CPS. {\copyright} 2018 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Pipes are one of the key elements in the construction of ships, which usually contain between 15,000 and 40,000 of them. This huge number, as well as the variety of processes that may be performed on a pipe, require rigorous identification, quality assessment and traceability. Traditionally, such tasks have been carried out by using manual procedures and following documentation on paper, which slows down the production processes and reduces the output of a pipe workshop. This article presents a system that allows for identifying and tracking the pipes of a ship through their construction cycle. For such a purpose, a fog computing architecture is proposed to extend cloud computing to the edge of the shipyard network. The system has been developed jointly by Navantia, one of the largest shipbuilders in the world, and the University of A Coru{\~n}a (Spain), through a project that makes use of some of the latest Industry 4.0 technologies. Specifically, a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is described, which uses active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags to track pipes and detect relevant events. Furthermore, the CPS has been integrated and tested in conjunction with Siemens' Manufacturing Execution System (MES) (Simatic IT). The experiments performed on the CPS show that, in the selected real-world scenarios, fog gateways respond faster than the tested cloud server, being such gateways are also able to process successfully more samples under high-load situations. In addition, under regular loads, fog gateways react between five and 481 times faster than the alternative cloud approach. {\copyright} 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Cyber-physical systems, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and Cloud computing, play a key role in the fourth industrial revolution known as Industry 4.0. The microservice architecture has evolved as an alternative to SOA and promises to address many of the challenges in software development. In this paper, we adopt the concept of microservice and describe a framework for manufacturing systems that has the cyber-physical microservice as the key construct. The manufacturing plant processes are defined as compositions of primitive cyber-physical microservices adopting either the orchestration or the choreography pattern. IoT technologies are used for system integration and model-driven engineering is utilized to semi-automate the development process for the industrial engineer, who is not familiar with microservices and IoT. Two case studies demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. {\copyright} 2018 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Industry 4.0 represents the fourth phase of industry and manufacturing revolution, unique in that it provides Internet-connected smart systems, including automated factories, organizations, development on demand, and 'just-in-time' development. Industry 4.0 includes the integration of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and fog computing paradigms for developing smart systems, smart homes, and smart cities. Given Industry 4.0 is comprised sensor fields, actuators, fog and cloud processing paradigms, and network systems, designing a secure architecture faces two major challenges: handling heterogeneous sources at scale and maintaining security over a large, disparate, data-driven system that interacts with the physical environment. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a new threat intelligence scheme that models the dynamic interactions of industry 4.0 components including physical and network systems. The scheme consists of two components: a smart management module and a threat intelligence module. The smart data management module handles heterogeneous data sources, one of the foundational requirements for interacting with an Industry 4.0 system. This includes data to and from sensors, actuators, in addition to other forms of network traffic. The proposed threat intelligence technique is designed based on beta mixture-hidden Markov models (MHMMs) for discovering anomalous activities against both physical and network systems. The scheme is evaluated on two well-known datasets: the CPS dataset of sensors and actuators and the UNSW-NB15 dataset of network traffic. The results reveal that the proposed technique outperforms five peer mechanisms, suggesting its effectiveness as a viable deployment methodology in real-Industry 4.0 systems. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an innovative fog computing middleware for distributed cooperative data analytics (DCDA) in the Internet of Things (IoT). The existing IoT systems gather data in a central place (e.g., cloud) for post-processing and high-level situation awareness. Such a collecte-and-compute paradigm cannot sustain the exponential sensors and data growth-the communication bandwidth is limited by spectrum and cannot catch up the data growth rate. In addition, many critical cyber-physical applications demand time-sensitive decisions, and privacy concerns prefer to avoid data collection. Distributed cooperative data analytics for high-level situation awareness can avoid costly data collection and meet the time and privacy requirements, and has received much attention in the past several years. In this work, we propose a DCDA architecture and middleware to support flexible and scalable DCDA, and test and validate the proposed middleware in seismic and ambient noise imaging case studies. The evaluation results in a fog computing testbed demonstrate that the DCDA middleware allows scalable and fault-tolerant data analytics and is suitable for real-time situation awareness under the bandwidth and communication constraints. {\copyright} 2017 IEEE.},

@article{Dautov201829822,
	Abstract = {Cloud and Fog computing have established a convenient and widely adopted approach for computation offloading, where raw data generated by edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) context is collected and processed remotely. This vertical offloading pattern, however, typically does not take into account increasingly pressing time constraints of the emerging IoT scenarios, in which numerous data sources, including human agents (i.e., Social IoT), continuously generate large amounts of data to be processed in a timely manner. Big data solutions could be applied in this respect, provided that networking issues and limitations related to connectivity of edge devices are properly addressed. Although edge devices are traditionally considered to be resource-constrained, main limitations refer to energy, networking, and memory capacities, whereas their ever-growing processing capabilities are already sufficient to be effectively involved in actual (big data) processing. In this context, the role of human agents is no longer limited to passive data generation, but can also include their voluntary involvement in relatively complex computations. This way, users can share their personal computational resources (i.e., mobile phones) to support collaborative data processing, thereby turning the existing IoT into a global cyber-physical-social system (CPSS). To this extent, this paper proposes a novel IoT/CPSS data processing pattern based on the stream processing technology, aiming to distribute the workload among a cluster of edge devices, involving mobile nodes shared by contributors on a voluntary basis, and paving the way for cluster computing at the edge. Experiments on an intelligent surveillance system deployed on an edge device cluster demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, illustrating how its distributed in-memory data processing architecture can be effective. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Owing1 to an immense growth of internet-connected and learning-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPSs) [1], several new types of attack vectors have emerged. Analyzing security and resilience of these complex CPSs is difficult as it requires evaluating many subsystems and factors in an integrated manner. Integrated simulation of physical systems and communication network can provide an underlying framework for creating a reusable and configurable testbed for such analyses. Using a model-based integration approach and the IEEE High-Level Architecture (HLA) [2] based distributed simulation software; we have created a testbed for integrated evaluation of large-scale CPS systems. Our tested supports web-based collaborative metamodeling and modeling of CPS system and experiments and a cloud computing environment for executing integrated networked co-simulations. A modular and extensible cyber-attack library enables validating the CPS under a variety of configurable cyber-attacks, such as DDoS and integrity attacks. Hardware-in-the-loop simulation is also supported along with several hardware attacks. Further, a scenario modeling language allows modeling of alternative paths (Courses of Actions) that enables validating CPS under different what-if scenarios as well as conducting cyber-gaming experiments. These capabilities make our testbed well suited for analyzing security and resilience of CPS. In addition, the web-based modeling and cloud-hosted execution infrastructure enables one to exercise the entire testbed using simply a web-browser, with integrated live experimental results display. {\copyright} 2018 ACM.},

	Abstract = {The continuous advance in manufacturing and information analytics has improved the connectivity between computational and physical elements within the industry, hence increasing the effectiveness and reliability of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This progress has been further enhanced by Cloud computing technologies, by externalizing services and interconnecting different industrial networks. As a consequence, there has been an increase of cyber-security threats in the industrial sector in recent years. Among other security measures, it is of paramount importance to introduce flexible access control mechanisms to avoid unauthorized access to the heterogeneous systems that coexist in this context. In this paper, we identify the requirements for such techniques, and propose a novel industrial architecture where multiple access control models are assessed when cloud technologies are integrated. In particular, we emphasize their adaptability to new heterogeneous scenarios through diverse indicators, achieving a trade-off between security and efficiency. {\copyright} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is a state-of-the-art architecture that integrates the cloud computing into the mobile environment and overcomes obstacles, such as processing capability, battery life, storage, and availability. Also the MCC is expected to be a key technology for cyber physical systems by connecting to vehicular systems, medical systems, and other mission-critical systems. Therefore, it is a critical issue for MCC to guarantee the high reliability. In this paper, we consider the component importance analysis of an MCC with common-cause failures (CCFs) by using a Markov reward model-based componentwise sensitivity approach. The component importance analysis is capable of quantifying the criticality of components and helps us to design the highly reliable system. In particular, this paper examines the effect of CCFs on the MCC. Our experimental results show that the preferred action to improve the availability of system with CCFs efficiently is to decrease the failure rate of the cloud node in the cloud infrastructure. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {The rapid development of information communication technology has led to the wide popularity of mobile devices, which have helped to improve business efficiency and enabled simple mobility as small and light devices and convenience of being available anytime, anywhere for cyber-physical-social big data. There are many ongoing studies on mobile cloud computing (MCC) to overcome the limited computing capability and storage capacity and internal battery limitation by taking advantage of the popularity of mobile devices for the processing cyber-physical-social big data. MCC consists of service-oriented architecture, agent-client architecture, and collaborative architecture, with job splitting and allocation as the critical factor. As such, job allocation techniques considering the performance resources of mobile devices have been studied. Note, however, that there is a problem of job reallocation due to continuous battery consumption, since the studies consider only the performance resources of mobile devices at the time of job allocation or take into account the performance resources and remaining battery power only. This paper proposes the job allocation mechanism (JAM) for battery consumption minimization of cyber-physical-social big data processing in MCC, which continuously reflects the battery consumption rate to process jobs with mobile devices only without an external cloud server in a collaborative architecture-based MCC environment. JAM allocates jobs considering the periodic measurement of battery consumption and surplus resource to minimize the problem of job reallocation due to battery rundown of the mobile devices. This paper designs and implements a system for verifying JAM and demonstrated that the job processing speed increased in an MCC environment for cyber-physical-social big data. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT) and heterogeneous Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems, monolithic and proprietary Smart Building (SB) systems are unable to address the challenges of scalability, adaptability, and security. Improved integration and interoperability of the existing and future technologies are essential for overcoming the barriers of SB adoption. This paper proposes a real-time, brokerless, and message-oriented middleware (MoM) system for interfacing and interconnecting the digital and physical assets of the SB. It provides a holistic abstraction to the building management system (BMS) of the underlying device protocols and building construction properties, simplifying the design and reducing the overall system cost. Its distributed architecture scales to any building construction regardless of the devices' performance and connectivity limitations. A secure architecture ensures the integrity of data and operations, and an extensive performance and energy efficiency study validates the proposed design. While MoM systems have been traditionally used in cloud computing, it is the first time that such approach, based on building-distributed embedded electronics and the efficient ZeroMQ messaging library, is successfully validated for a cyber-physical system like the SB. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Nowadays the healthcare system is undergoing a paradigm shift to integrate cloud computing and Internet-of-Things with physical medical equipments into a distributed network ensuring real-time and near real-time data transfer from the physical world to the cyber space for computation, storage and analysis. Namely, the healthcare system can be seen as a cyber--physical system (CPS) for patient-centric healthcare applications and services, called Health-CPS, based on cloud computing, Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) and big data analytics technologies. Health-CPS has played an important role in healthcare for improving treatment quality and patients' assistance speed. However, despite these advantages, the development of Health-CPS will be restricted by serious security threats, especially the security threats to the healthcare-related data. Because Health-CPS forward Electronic health records (EHRs), biomedical signals of patients and public health to the cloud which may operate in distributed and hostile environments, novel security mechanisms are required to prevent malicious interactions to the storage infrastructure. Therefore, the cloud providers must take strong security measures to protect the integrity and privacy of the healthcare related data. But most of the researchers do not simultaneously pay attention to both integrity and privacy for Health-CPS. Therefore, we proposed a privacy-preserving data integrity verification model by using lightweight streaming authenticated data structures for Health-CPS. We have given the design idea, architecture, formal definition, security definition, communication protocols of our model in detail. The key construction processes of our model which include initialization, data appending, scale expansion, data query and verification, are also given in this paper. Finally, the security and performance analysis show that our scheme is not only secure but also efficient. {\copyright} 2018},

Enterprises are presently transforming their strategy, culture, processes, and their information systems to become more digital. The digital transformation deeply disrupts existing enterprises and economies. Digitization fosters the development of IT environments with many rather small and distributed structures, like Internet of Things. This has a strong impact for architecting digital services and products. The change from a closed-world modeling perspective to more flexible open-world and living software and system architectures defines the moving context for adaptable and evolutionary software approaches, which are essential to enable the digital transformation. In this paper, we are putting a spotlight to service-oriented software evolution to support the digital transformation with micro-granular digital architectures for digital services and products.

	Abstract = {Cyber Physical System (CPS) together with Internet of Things, Big Data, Cloud Computing and Industrial Wireless Networks are the core technologies allowing the introduction of the fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0. Along with the advances in new generation information technologies, smart manufacturing is becoming the focus of global manufacturing transformation. Considering the competitive nature of industry, it requires manufacturers to implement new methodologies. Realistic virtual models mirroring the real world are becoming essential to bridge the gap between design and manufacturing. In this paper model conceptualization, representation, and implementation of the digital twin is presented, on the real use case of manufacturing industry and in the cyber physical environment. A novel CPS architecture for real time visualization of complex industrial process is proposed. It essentially considers the Simulation technological pillar of Industry 4.0. The results from a real industrial environment show good performances in terms of real time behaviour, virtual reality and WebGL CPS visualization features, usability and readability. {\copyright} 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

	Abstract = {Industry 4.0 is expected to deliver significant gains in productivity by assimilating several technological advancements including cloud computing, the Internet-of-Things, and smart devices. However, it is unclear how these technologies should be leveraged together to deliver the promised benefits. We present the architecture design of an information system that integrates these technologies to support hybrid manufacturing processes, i.e., processes in which human and robotic workers collaborate. We show how well-structured architecture design is the basis for a modular, complex cyber-physical system that provides horizontal, cross-functional manufacturing process management and vertical control of heterogenous work cells. The modular nature allows the extensible cloud support enhancing its accessibility to small and medium enterprises. The information system is designed as part of the HORSE Project: a five-year research and innovation project aimed at making recent technological advancements more accessible to small and medium manufacturing enterprises. The project consortium includes 10 factories to represent the typical problems encountered on the factory floor and provide real-world environments to test and evaluate the developed information system. The resulting information system architecture model is proposed as a reference architecture for a manufacturing operations management system for Industry 4.0. As a reference architecture, it serves two purposes: (1) it frames the scientific inquiry and advancement of information systems for Industry 4.0 and (2) it can be used as a template to develop commercial-grade manufacturing applications for Industry 4.0. {\copyright} 2019 by the authors.},

	Abstract = {- Recently, cloud manufacturing (CMfg) has received a growing amount of attention among researchers in the manufacturing community. Cloud manufacturing is a customer-driven manufacturing model inspired by cloud computing. Its aim is to provide everything as a service. One of the main issues of CMfg is an interaction between the smart components on the smart factory for providing manufacturing as a service based on the cyber-physical system. This interaction and connection should provide trust between the provider and user. However, the current CMfg architecture developed based on a centralized structure, which brings centralization problems for service providers also trust based data sharing on the shop floor level. Also, shop floor level connection is not deeply study based on security problems. In this respect, we try to expend our previous concept of blockchain cloud manufacturing (BCMfg), in the shop floor level, we focused on machine level connection, and shop floor data sharing based on blockchain technology (BCT). Therefore, this paper used two type blockchain network; public and private for manufacturing service providers on the CMfg. The public BCN used for service provider level and private BCN used for shop level, which is connected to machine level for data receiving and gathering. The proposed architecture is explained and advantages are defined. {\copyright} Smart SysTech 2018 - European Conference on Smart Objects, Systems and Technologies. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Evolving business models, computing paradigms, and management practices are rapidly re-shaping the usage models of ICT infrastructures, and demanding for more flexibility and dynamicity in enterprise security, beyond the traditional "security perimeter" approach. Since valuable ICT assets cannot be easily enclosed within a trusted physical sandbox any more, there is an increasing need for a new generation of pervasive and capillary cyber-security paradigms over distributed and geographically-scattered systems. Following the generalized trend towards virtualization, automation, software-definition, and hardware/software disaggregation, in this paper we elaborate on a multi-tier architecture made of a common, programmable, and pervasive data-plane and a powerful set of multi-vendor detection and analysis algorithms. Our approach leverages the growing level of programmability of ICT infrastructures to create a common and unified framework that could be used to monitor and protect distributed heterogeneous environments, including legacy enterprise networks, IoT installations, and virtual resources deployed in the cloud. {\copyright} 2018 CEUR-WS.

	Abstract = {Rapid advances in industrialisation and informatisation methods have spurred tremendous progress in developing the next generation of manufacturing technology. Today, we are on the cusp of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In 2013, amongst one of 10 `Future Projects' identified by the German government as part of its High-Tech Strategy 2020 Action Plan, the Industry 4.0 project is considered to be a major endeavour for Germany to establish itself as a leader of integrated industry. In 2014, China's State Council unveiled their ten-year national plan, Made-in-China 2025, which was designed to transform China from the world's workshop into a world manufacturing power. Made-in-China 2025 is an initiative to comprehensively upgrade China's industry including the manufacturing sector. In Industry 4.0 and Made-in-China 2025, many applications require a combination of recently emerging new technologies, which is giving rise to the emergence of Industry 4.0. Such technologies originate from different disciplines including cyber-physical Systems, IoT, cloud computing, Industrial Integration, Enterprise Architecture, SOA, Business Process Management, Industrial Information Integration and others. At this present moment, the lack of powerful tools still poses a major obstacle for exploiting the full potential of Industry 4.0. In particular, formal methods and systems methods are crucial for realising Industry 4.0, which poses unique challenges. In this paper, we briefly survey the state of the art in the area of Industry 4.0 as it relates to industries. {\copyright} 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	Abstract = {Current developments in ICTs such as in Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber--Physical Systems (CPS) allow us to develop healthcare solutions with more intelligent and prediction capabilities both for daily life (home/office) and in-hospitals. In most of IoT-based healthcare systems, especially at smart homes or hospitals, a bridging point (i.e., gateway) is needed between sensor infrastructure network and the Internet. The gateway at the edge of the network often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks. These gateways have beneficial knowledge and constructive control over both the sensor network and the data to be transmitted through the Internet. In this paper, we exploit the strategic position of such gateways at the edge of the network to offer several higher-level services such as local storage, real-time local data processing, embedded data mining, etc., presenting thus a Smart e-Health Gateway. We then propose to exploit the concept of Fog Computing in Healthcare IoT systems by forming a Geo-distributed intermediary layer of intelligence between sensor nodes and Cloud. By taking responsibility for handling some burdens of the sensor network and a remote healthcare center, our Fog-assisted system architecture can cope with many challenges in ubiquitous healthcare systems such as mobility, energy efficiency, scalability, and reliability issues. A successful implementation of Smart e-Health Gateways can enable massive deployment of ubiquitous health monitoring systems especially in clinical environments. We also present a prototype of a Smart e-Health Gateway called UT-GATE where some of the discussed higher-level features have been implemented. We also implement an IoT-based Early Warning Score (EWS) health monitoring to practically show the efficiency and relevance of our system on addressing a medical case study. Our proof-of-concept design demonstrates an IoT-based health monitoring system with enhanced overall system intelligence, energy efficiency, mobility, performance, interoperability, security, and reliability. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) have gained an increasing attention recently for their immense potential towards the next generation smart systems that integrate cyber technology into the physical processes. However, CPS did not initiate either smart factories or smart manufacturing, and vice versa. Historically, the smart factory was initially studied with the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT) in manufacturing, and later became a key part of Industry 4.0. Also emerging are other related models such as cloud manufacturing, social manufacturing and proactive manufacturing with the introduction of cloud computing (broadly, the Internet of Services, IoS), social networking (broadly, the Internet of People, IoP) and big data (broadly, the Internet of Content and Knowledge, IoCK), respectively. At present, there is a lack of a systemic and comprehensive study on the linkages and relations between these terms. Therefore, this study first presents a comprehensive survey and analysis of the CPS treated as a combination of the IoT and the IoS. Then, the paper addresses CPS-based smart manufacturing as an eight tuple of CPS,IoT, IoS and IoCK as elements. Further, the paper extends the eight-tuple CPS-based manufacturing to social-CPS (SCPS)-based manufacturing, termed wisdom manufacturing, which forms a nine tuple with the addition of one more element, the IoP and which is based on the SCPS instead of CPS. Both architectures and characteristics for smart and wisdom manufacturing are addressed. As such, these terms' linkages are established and relations are clarified with a special discussion. This study thus contributes as a theoretical basis and as a comprehensive framework for emerging manufacturing integration. {\copyright} 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

	Abstract = {Nowadays, the growing global economy and demand for customized products are bringing the manufacturing industry from a sellers' market toward a buyers' market. In this context, the smart manufacturing enabled by Industry 4.0 is changing the whole production cycle of companies specialized on different kinds of products. On one hand, the advent of cloud computing and social media makes the customers' experience more and more inclusive, whereas on the other hand cyber-physical system technologies help industries to change in real time the cycle of production according to customers' needs. In this context, 'retention' marketing strategies aimed not only at the acquisition of new customers but also at the profitability of existing ones allow industries to apply specific production strategies so as to maximize their revenues. This is possible by means of the analysis of various kinds of information coming from customers, products, purchases, and so on. In this paper, we focus on customer loyalty programs. In particular, we propose cloud-based software as a service architecture that store and analyses big data related to purchases and products' ranks in order to provide customers a list of recommended products. Experiments focus on a prototype of human to machine workflow for the pre-selection of customers deployed on both private and hybrid cloud scenarios. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

Dependability of M-CPSs is subject to timely, reliable, and secure information exchange among M-CPS entities. Information exchange provisioning in such systems is conventionally built with sole reliance on wireless connectivity. The conventional approaches, however, fail to efficiently exploit dynamism and heterogeneity, and to incorporate computing/cooperation as alternative system-wide tools for information exchange. To address these issues, we approach M-CPSs dependability from the information exchange perspective and define dependable-exchange-of-information (DeX) indicating collective M-CPS capability of information exchange provisioning. We then propose a cloud-based architecture for DeX provisioning as a service to facilitate versatile development of dependable M-CPSs. {\copyright} 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {A Cyber-Physical Manufacturing Cloud (CPMC) is an Internet-of-Things (IoT) enabled manufacturing framework that facilitates monitoring and operation of manufacturing machine tools remotely through the integration of IoT, cyber-physical systems, cloud computing, and advanced manufacturing technologies. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop a communication method of manufacturing services over the Internet in order to access and manage manufacturing resources from the cloud. This paper presents a semantic ontology based Internet scale communication method of manufacturing services named Machine Tool Communication (MTComm) in a CPMC to enable manufacturing with various physically connected machines from geographically distributed locations over the Internet. This paper presents design of an agent-adapter architecture of the communication method of exchanging manufacturing services across Internet, a semantic ontological representation of manufacturing machines and services, and specification of the ontology based MTComm method. It is the first Internet scale manufacturing service communication method of enabling manufacturing operations over the internet in addition to monitoring manufacturing services. MTComm is a significant improvement over the MTConnect, a widely popular communication method of manufacturing services which allows only monitoring machine tools over the Internet. It is implemented and tested in a testbed of the CPMC to analyze its performance in multiple manufacturing application scenarios. The experiments demonstrate excellent feasibility of monitoring and performing manufacturing operations over the Internet. {\copyright} 2017 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Cloud Computing (CC) is a fast-growing technology to perform massive-scale and complex computing. It eliminates the need to maintain expensive computing hardware, dedicated space, and software. Recently, it has been observed that massive growth in the scale of data or big data generated through cloud computing. CC consists of a front-end, includes the users' computers and software required to access the cloud network, and back-end consists of various computers, servers and database systems that create the cloud. In SaaS (Software as-a-Service - end users to utilize outsourced software), PaaS (Platform as-a-Service-platform is provided) and IaaS (Infrastructure as-a-Service-physical environment is outsourced), and DaaS (Database as-a-Service-data can be housed within a cloud), where leading / traditional cloud ecosystem delivers the cloud services become a powerful and popular architecture. Many challenges and issues are in security or threats, most vital barrier for cloud computing environment. The main barrier to the adoption of CC in health care relates to Data security. When placing and transmitting data using public networks, cyber attacks in any form are anticipated in CC. Hence, cloud service users need to understand the risk of data breaches and adoption of service delivery model during deployment. This survey deeply covers the CC security issues (covering Data Security in Health care) so as to researchers can develop the robust security application models using Big Data (BD) on CC (can be created / deployed easily). Since, BD evaluation is driven by fast-growing cloud-based applications developed using virtualized technologies. In this purview, MapReduce [12] is a good example of big data processing in a cloud environment, and a model for Cloud providers. {\copyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Industry 4.0 has become more popular due to recent developments in cyber-physical systems, big data, cloud computing, and industrial wireless networks. Intelligent manufacturing has produced a revolutionary change, and evolving applications, such as product lifecycle management, are becoming a reality. In this paper, we propose and implement a manufacturing big data solution for active preventive maintenance in manufacturing environments. First, we provide the system architecture that is used for active preventive maintenance. Then, we analyze the method used for collection of manufacturing big data according to the data characteristics. Subsequently, we perform data processing in the cloud, including the cloud layer architecture, the real-time active maintenance mechanism, and the offline prediction and analysis method. Finally, we analyze a prototype platform and implement experiments to compare the traditionally used method with the proposed active preventive maintenance method. The manufacturing big data method used for active preventive maintenance has the potential to accelerate implementation of Industry 4.0. {\copyright} 2017 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {The Bonseyes EU H2020 collaborative project aims to develop a platform consisting of a Data Marketplace, a Deep Learning Toolbox, and Developer Reference Platforms for organizations wanting to adopt Artificial Intelligence. The project will be focused on using artificial intelligence in low power Internet of Things (IoT) devices ("edge computing"), embedded computing systems, and data center servers ("cloud computing"). It will bring about orders of magnitude improvements in efficiency, performance, reliability, security, and productivity in the design and programming of systems of artificial intelligence that incorporate Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). In addition, it will solve a causality problem for organizations who lack access to Data and Models. Its open software architecture will facilitate adoption of the whole concept on a wider scale. To evaluate the effectiveness, technical feasibility, and to quantify the real-world improvements in efficiency, security, performance, effort and cost of adding AI to products and services using the Bonseyes platform, four complementary demonstrators will be built. Bonseyes platform capabilities are aimed at being aligned with the European FI-PPP activities and take advantage of its flagship project FIWARE.

	Abstract = {Cyber-physical systems are integrations of computation, networking, and physical processes and they are increasingly finding applications in manufacturing. Cloud manufacturing integrates cloud computing and service-oriented technologies with manufacturing processes and provides manufacturing services in manufacturing clouds. A cyber physical system for manufacturing is not a manufacturing cloud if it does not use virtualization technique in cloud computing and service oriented architecture in service computing. On the other hand, a manufacturing cloud is not cyber physical system if it does not have components for direct interactions with machine tools and other physical devices. In this paper, a new paradigm of Cyber-Physical Manufacturing Cloud (CPMC) is introduced to bridge gaps among cloud computing, cyber physical systems, and manufacturing. A CPMC allows direct operations and monitoring of machine tools in a manufacturing cloud over the Internet. A scalable and service-oriented layered architecture of CPMC is developed. It allows publication and subscription of manufacturing web services and cross-platform applications in CPMC. A virtualization method of manufacturing resources in CPMC is presented. In addition, communication mechanisms between the layers of the CPMC using communication protocols such as MTConnect, TCP/IP, and REST are discussed. A CPMC testbed is developed and implemented based on the proposed architecture. The testbed is fully operational in two geographically distributed sites. The developed testbed is evaluated using several manufacturing scenarios. Its testing results demonstrate that it can monitor and execute manufacturing operations remotely over the Internet efficiently in a manufacturing cloud. {\copyright} 2017 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

	Abstract = {Softwarization approaches in networks, storages, M2M, services, and smart things aim to optimize costs and processes and bring new infrastructure definitions and functional values. A recent integration of wireless and mobile cyber physical systems with the dramatically growing smart sensors enables a new type of pervasive smart and mobile urban surveillance infrastructures, which opens up new opportunities for boosting the accuracy, efficiency, and productivity of uninterrupted target tracking and situation awareness. In this paper, we present a design and prototype of a mobility-inspired efficient and effective fog system using software-defined control over a mobile and wireless environment (MIST). Fog Computing, a recently proposed extension and complement for cloud computing, enables computing at the network edge in a smart device without outsourcing jobs to a remote cloud. We investigated an effective softwarization approach in the Fog environment for dynamic big data driven, real-time urban surveillance tasks of uninterrupted target tracking. We address key technical challenges of node mobility to improve the system awareness. We have built a preliminary proof-of-concept MIST architecture on both Android and Linux based smart devices and tested various collaboration scenarios among the mobile sensors. {\copyright} 2017 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {This book provides formal and informal definitions and taxonomies for self-aware computing systems, and explains how self-aware computing relates to many existing subfields of computer science, especially software engineering. It describes architectures and algorithms for self-aware systems as well as the benefits and pitfalls of self-awareness, and reviews much of the latest relevant research across a wide array of disciplines, including open research challenges. The chapters of this book are organized into five parts: Introduction, System Architectures, Methods and Algorithms, Applications and Case Studies, and Outlook. Part I offers an introduction that defines self-aware computing systems from multiple perspectives, and establishes a formal definition, a taxonomy and a set of reference scenarios that help to unify the remaining chapters. Next, Part II explores architectures for self-aware computing systems, such as generic concepts and notations that allow a wide range of self-aware system architectures to be described and compared with both isolated and interacting systems. It also reviews the current state of reference architectures, architectural frameworks, and languages for self-aware systems. Part III focuses on methods and algorithms for self-aware computing systems by addressing issues pertaining to system design, like modeling, synthesis and verification. It also examines topics such as adaptation, benchmarks and metrics. Part IV then presents applications and case studies in various domains including cloud computing, data centers, cyber-physical systems, and the degree to which self-aware computing approaches have been adopted within those domains. Lastly, Part V surveys open challenges and future research directions for self-aware computing systems. It can be used as a handbook for professionals and researchers working in areas related to self-aware computing, and can also serve as an advanced textbook for lecturers and postgraduate students studying subjects like advanced software engineering, autonomic computing, self-adaptive systems, and data-center resource management. Each chapter is largely self-contained, and offers plenty of references for anyone wishing to pursue the topic more deeply. {\copyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

	Abstract = {Virtualization technology has the potential to notably advance the automation process in the domain of cyber-physical systems (CPS). It can improve both dependability and availability as well as significantly reduce the procurement, operation and maintenance costs of such systems. However, in the context of virtualization, research has put the most emphasis on topics of hardware utilization and fault-tolerance. There is little literature on how to model, integrate and consolidate a CPS by means of virtualization. In this paper we present a methodology for planning safe and efficient virtualized cyber-physical compute and control clusters -- execution platforms for time-constrained virtual machines (VMs) that encapsulate CPS applications. We discuss the used methods, describe the corresponding models and the required system architecture. In contrast to typical resource allocation problems from other domains (e.g. cloud computing), in this case, the planning process must take real-time requirements of applications into account. In order to achieve this, we combine evolutionary algorithms with formal system performance analysis -- in particular algorithms considered in classical scheduling theory. Such an approach allows not only to optimally dimension the compute and control clusters, but also provides strict guarantees regarding the timing predictability of the integrated CPS. Further, the embedment of a formal performance analysis technique notably eases the modeling of a system. As a consequence, the modeling process is fast, flexible and accessible not only to experts but also to system designers as they do not have to struggle with complex and time consuming mathematical formulations. Finally, our approach also provides answers to several practical questions that arise when integrating a CPS by means of virtualization. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we describe our ongoing work on modeling services in industry domains. Nowadays, many large software systems that are developed for industry are mainly built from services. Yet, modeling services and their interaction still remain a challenging task. Moreover, new emerged technologies such as cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), microservices, "smart" factories and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) create additional concerns and need to be integrated into existing models. This imposes a change to the monolithic architectures used to model service interaction and cooperation. In this work, we argue that modeling interaction of services can be handled more effectively by modeling services with the role modeling (RM) approach. Afterwards, we aim to exploit the modeling features and formally present the RM diagrams to using a logic system where we will be able to reason over the composition of services in industry domains. {\copyright} 2017 ACM.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of devising an effective information fusion architecture for a task scheduling algorithm which facilitates data processing of a Cyber Physical System (CPS) under bounded latency for bursty or lossy traflic. Task scheduling traditionally caters to real-time systems where a feedback loop does not exist aIIoiing the serviced application to be independent of the inputs from the server. However, owing to the nature of a near real-time CPS, such liberties cannot be entertained. Additionally, the adient of big data in CPS has necessitated the use of Cloud Computing as a scalable and cost effective alternative. Task scheduling in such CPSs, where inputs from the Cloud complete the feedback loop is a major research issue. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multilayered information fusion architecture which integrates such a task scheduling mechanism by accommodating both traffic bursts and packet losses. Our scheduling algorithm ensures that the overall latency always remains under an acceptable upper bound as required by the CPS application. {\copyright} 2016 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {As the most promising computing paradigm, cloud computing opens up new horizons for the area of high-performance distributed computing. Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs) present novel digital systems, which integrate computation, communication and the control of physical resource. Applied CPSs architecture in cloud computing can provide real-time and scalable resource monitoring and offer time-critical applications. With unrivaled scalability and flexibility, the CPSs based cloud services brings significant convenience to customers in need of elastic computing power. The quality of CPSs based cloud services is, to an large extent, determined by the performance of Virtual Machine (VM) placement algorithm for the data center. VM placement also effect the communication between applications and physical resource distribution in cloud computing CPSs.The traditional VM placement algorithm is built upon the two-tier architecture. With the presence of multi-media applications, the application level controller cannot accurately quantify the varying amount computing resources required by VMs at runtime. Consequently, lacking accurate resource demand for each VM, controller at the data center level cannot generate the VM placement with satisfactory feasibility. This architecture no longer fits the modern data centers. In this paper, the two tier VM placement framework is proposed to resolve this technical challenge. Our LP-based variation-unaware VM placement algorithm generates the VM placement with minimized energy consumption. On the other hand, our feasibility driven stochastic VM placement (FDSP) algorithm works seamlessly with the LP-based algorithm to achieve desirable feasibility of the placement. Our experimental results show that the LP-based variation unaware VM placement algorithm improves the energy consumption by 15.3% on average from the baseline algorithm. For test cases with resource request variations, the FDSP algorithm saves 15.7% energy cost compared to the "worst case scenario" of the traditional VM placement paradigm. On the other hand, it improves the feasibility by 50.0% compared to the "best case scenario". {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {The convergence of information technology and operational technology is a strong force in fabric automation. Service-oriented architectures and cloud computing technologies expand into next generation production systems. Those technologies enable a lot of new possibilities; such as high agility, global connectivity and high computing capacities. However, they also bring huge challenges regarding flexibility and reliability through increasing system dynamics, complexity and heterogenity. New solution patterns are needed to conquer those challenges. This paper proposes a new fog-oriented approach, which shows how future production systems, that are often called cyber-physical production systems, can deal with dynamically changing services and infrastructure elements. The goal is to provide an adequate degree of flexibility and reliability across the whole production lifecycle. Therefore, an event property model ("bubble model"), a multi-criterial evaluation metric and extensions to Kuhn-Munkres and Add algorithm are described. The overall concept is evaluated by an application example from the field of process engineering. With the help of practical case studies and dynamic system simulations, qualitative results are gained. {\copyright}2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

	Abstract = {With the integration and extensive applications for new generation of information technologies (such as cloud computing, internet of things, big data, mobile internet, artificial intelligence) in manufacturing industry, a number of countries had put forward their national advanced manufacturing development strategies, such as Industry 4.0 in Germany, Industrial Internet and manufacturing system based on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in USA, as well as Made in China 2025 and Internet Plus Manufacturing in China. Although each of these strategies was proposed under different circumstances, one of the common purposes of these strategies was to achieve the interconnection, interoperability between physical world and the information world of manufacturing and the intelligent operation of manufacturing. As one of bottlenecks to achieve this purpose, the communication and interaction between the physical world and the information world of manufacturing must be solved. To solve the problem, a novel concept of Digital Twin Workshop (DTW) based on digital twin was proposed. Complementary to the concept, the characteristics, architecture, system composition, operating mechanism and enabling key technologies were also elaborated and discussed respectively. On this basis, the theory and implementation of the communication and interaction between physical and information world of workshop based on workshop digital twin data were discussed. {\copyright} 2017, Editorial Department of CIMS.

	Abstract = {The industry is constantly moving towards the research, implementation and deployment of new solutions that permit the optimization of processes. Nowadays, such solutions consist mostly on ICT developments, which permit the collection, distribution, integration, analysis, and manipulation of heterogeneous data. The under way Cloud Collaborative Manufacturing Networks (C2NET) project targets the development of cloud-enabled tools for supporting the SMEs supply network optimization of manufacturing and logistic assets. The C2NET solution includes the implementation of paradigms as e.g. cloud computing or service-oriented and event-driven architectures, used for wide data integration. Among its requirements, the C2NET platform needs a solution for catch, process and react to events triggered in different locations of collaborative manufacturing networks, which are endowed with devices that permits the integration of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This paper presents the architecture and main functionality of a knowledge-based approach that allows processing supply chain events handled by CPS devices. The main component of the presented solution is the SECA ontology, which is a knowledge base that can be updated at runtime. The main purpose of the ontology is to describe events, their status and the actions to be performed once a set of events are triggered in certain order. This research work offers a solution that can be employed by the C2NET platform not only to catch and process events; but also to notify linked data consumers. {\copyright} 2016 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Starting with the invention of the steam engine in the 18th century, the industrial revolutions formed an ecosystem of over 20 billion connected devices with unforeseeable influence to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Predictions are that, by 2020 the connectable assets will generate about 44 ZB of data, which pose interesting challenges related to privacy, connectivity, scalability and others. A current line of action is the development of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), which can be monitored and controlled by private clouds or edge systems. Our approach is to bring functionalities, such as analytics, as close to the devices as possible (denoted as Fog Computing) to reduce latency and enhance data privacy and communication robustness. As a starting point we're extending a standard-compliant Machine- To-Machine Communication (M2M) architecture with containerbased orchestration mechanisms to enable CPSs to be programmable, autonomous and to communicate peer-To-peer. As the main field of application we are considering in particular smart factory environments and Industrial Internet domains in general. {\copyright} 2016 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Advances in mobile computing along with recent emerging technologies such as the smart grid and cloud computing are paving the way for a wide range of mobile cloud networking services and applications. In the smart grid cyber-physical environment, smart mobile devices communicate with the smart grid ecosystem via the control center, which plays a central role in selling and buying energy from smart grid users. The smart grid cyber-physical system can be viewed as a hierarchical architecture made up of a cyber plane and a physical plane. All smart devices reside in the physical plane, whereas in the cyber plane computing and communication resources are provided by the cloud server-based control center in smart grid. We propose an intelligent, energy-efficient scheme in smart grid cyber-physical systems using coalition-based game theory. All smart devices located at the physical plane are taken as the players in the coalition game. We developed a payoff function for each player in the coalition game based on transmission of information and service delays using conditional entropy for various smart devices at the physical plane. We analyzed the existence of the Nash equilibrium with incomplete information using various actions performed by the players in the game in the proposed scheme. Finally, we evaluated the performance of our proposed solution using performance evaluation metrics such as energy difference, overhead generated, and delay incurred. {\copyright} 2016 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Recently, with many advances in wireless sensor networks, big data, mobile and cloud computing, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) can tightly couple cyber space with the physical world better than ever before. Also, the cloud-based systems can provide massive storage resources and low-cost computing as well as the flexibility of customizing the operating environment to Complex Industrial Applications (CIA). In our view, Cloud-integrated CPS (CCPS) will open the door to allow previously unachievable application scenarios to be built, deployed, managed and controlled effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture of CCPS (termed CCPSA) and outline the enabling technologies for CIA. Then, we dissect three potential challenges and provide solutions from the perspective of CIA, including virtualized resource management techniques, the scheduling of cloud resources, and life cycle management. We hope this paper can provide insight and a roadmap for future research efforts in the emerging field of CCPS. {\copyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in wireless communications, mobile connectivity, and cloud computing have paved a way for all the devices and applications of Internet of Things (IoT), within which information from all related perspectives is closely monitored and synchronized between physical facilities, such as transportation carriers and the cyber computational space. Smartphone and tablets have developed into popular devices with the proper permission from the message recipients for reading and watching many forms of mobile advertisement. Advertisers endeavor to attract their target customers by fully presenting their ads fluently. While 2D Animation has been a category of completely mature art forms, there is broad space for collaborative utilization on both commercial and artistic value. The animated film possesses excellent cost-performance ratio to be produced, broadcasted and decoded adaptively in various transmission and display media especially when it comes to real-time and personal-profiled plot placement marketing along with geo-information technologies. A cyber-physical system (CPS) framework for mobile advertising with location-based plot placement 2D animation has been derived and yet to be implemented and deployed. In this work, we derived the flowcharts and experience use case. A high-level operational architecture is then designed. Based on user experience theories, the marketing plans for plot placement are proposed and examined. With the high global penetration of mobile devices and the prosperous development of IoT solutions, the schemes of internet marketing are to be highly cross-fielded and plot placement 2D animation CPS will surely play a very important role. {\copyright} 2016 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Assembly systems constitute one of the most important fields in today's industry. The need for flexibility in the assembly process imposes several challenges in the development of this kind of systems. Model-driven engineering (MDE) has been successfully used to alleviate the complexity of platforms and express domain concepts effectively. In this paper, an open distributed architecture for the engineering of evolvable flexible hybrid assembly systems is described. The proposed architecture is based on the model-driven development paradigm. Models are used to represent in a formalized way the structure, the behavior, and the requirements of the assembly systems. A domain-specific engineering tool is defined to facilitate the assembly system engineer in the engineering process of assembly systems. Specific meta-models are defined to capture domain knowledge and guide the engineer in the construction of the models required to construct the assembly system. The proposed approach imposes a correct-by-construction approach and is based on an architecture that exploits the benefits of Cyber Physical paradigm utilizing web technologies, Internet of Things, and Cloud computing. {\copyright} 2015, Springer-Verlag London.},

	Abstract = {If a network is not secure, how valuable is it? Introduction to Computer Networks and Cybersecurity takes an integrated approach to networking and cybersecurity, highlighting the interconnections so that you quickly understand the complex design issues in modern networks. This full-color book uses a wealth of examples and illustrations to effectively connect the principles of networks and networking protocols with the relevant cybersecurity issues. Get the Fundamentals of Internet Architecture and the Protocol Layers Organized into six parts, the book walks you through the fundamentals, starting with the way most people first encounter computer networks-through the Internet architecture. Part 1 covers the most important Internet applications and the methods used to develop them. Part 2 discusses the network edge, consisting of hosts, access networks, LANs, and the physical media used with the physical and link layers. Part 3 explores the network core, including packet/circuit switches, routers, and the Internet backbone, and Part 4 examines reliable transport and the management of network congestion. Learn about Malware and Security Systems Building on the concepts and principles, the book then delves into state-of-the-art cybersecurity mechanisms in Part 5. It reviews the types of malware and the various security systems, made up of firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other components. Crucially, it provides a seamless view of an information infrastructure in which security capabilities are built in rather than treated as an add-on feature. The book closes with a look at emerging technologies, including virtualization and data center and cloud computing unified communication. Understand Cyber Attacks-and What You Can Do to Defend against Them This comprehensive text supplies a carefully designed introduction to both the fundamentals of networks and the latest advances in Internet security. Addressing cybersecurity from an Internet perspective, it prepares you to better understand the motivation and methods of cyber attacks and what you can do to protect the networks and the applications that run on them. Pedagogical Features The book's modular design offers exceptional flexibility, whether you want to use it for quick reference, self-study, or a wide variety of one- or two-semester courses in computer networks, cybersecurity, or a hybrid of both. Learning goals in each chapter show you what you can expect to learn, and end-of-chapter problems and questions test your understanding. Throughout, the book uses real-world examples and extensive illustrations and screen captures to explain complicated concepts simply and clearly. Ancillary materials, including PowerPoint{\textregistered} animations, are available to instructors with qualifying course adoption. {\copyright} 2013 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

	Abstract = {Recent security threats against cyber-physical critical power grid infrastructures have further distinguished the differences and complex interdependencies between optimal plant control and infrastructural safety topics. In this paper, we reflect upon few real-world scenarios and threats to understand how those two topics meet. We then propose a practical architectural solutions to address the corresponding concerns. As a first concrete step, we focus on networked industrial control systems in smart grid where several sensing-processing-Actuation embedded nodes receive information, make control decisions, and carry out optimal actions. Traditionally, global safety maintenance, e.g., transient stability, is embedded into control and taken into account by the decision making modules. With recent cyber security-induced safety incidents, we believe that the safety-handling modules should also be considered as a part of global trusted computing base (attack surface) for security purposes. Generally, maximizing the system's overall security requires the designers to minimize its trusted computing base. Consequently, we argue that the traditional combined safety-control system architecture is not anymore the optimal design paradigm to follow given existing threats. Instead, we propose PLCLOUD, a new cloud-based safety-preserving architecture that places a minimal trusted safety verifier layer between the physical world and the cyber-based supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) infrastructure, specifically programmable logic controllers (PLCs). PLCLOUD's main objective is to take care of infrastructural safety and separate it from optimal plant control that SCADA is responsible for. {\copyright} 2015 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) represent a new generation of digital systems, where cyber entities and physical devices cooperate towards a set of common goals. The research presented in this paper aims to contribute to the development of CPSs by proposing: (1) an analysis methodology to model the CPS's behavior in terms of dependability; and (2) a CPS architecture with dependability facilities applicable in environmental monitoring, based on the Wireless Sensor Network, multi-agent and cloud computing technologies. The proposed methodology combines a primary dependability analysis technique with the representation of knowledge in order to support the development of CPSs capable to model the dependability at run-time. A dependability domain ontology has been implemented on a CPS case study based on this methodology and its effectiveness has been demonstrated, showing how the proposed approach is able to enhance system dependability. Also, the paper provides a detailed description of each architectural layer of the CPS case study, focusing on the wireless sensor node and on the intelligent decision system. {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Cloud computing in conjunction with recent advances in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) unravels new opportunities for the European manufacturing industry for high value-added products that can quickly reach the market for sale. The Internet of Things joins the Internet of Services to enact the fourth industrial revolution that digitalises the manufacturing techniques and logistics while pushing forward the development of improved factories with machine-to-machine communication delivering massively customised products tailored to the individualised needs of the customer. Interconnected CPSs using internal and cross-organizational services cooperate in real time increase the business agility and flexibility of manufacturing companies. Using CPS with cloud computing architectures leverage data and services stored and run in cloud environment from different vendors that usually offer different service interfaces to share their services and data. However, when using such architectures data silos appear and different vendors having different service interfaces can easily result in vendor lock-in issues. This paper proposes a multi-cloud marketplace architecture leveraging the existing myriad of different cloud environments at different abstraction levels including the Infrastructure-, Platform-, and Software-asa- Service cloud models-that is, Everything as a Service or XaaS-delivering services and with different properties that can control the computation happening in multiple cloud environments sharing resources with 6422707other. {\copyright} IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016.},

	Abstract = {Over the past few decades, both small- and medium-sized manufacturers as well as large original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have been faced with an increasing need for low cost and scalable intelligent manufacturing machines. Capabilities are needed for collecting and processing large volumes of real-time data generated from manufacturing machines and processes as well as for diagnosing the root cause of identified defects, predicting their progression, and forecasting maintenance actions proactively to minimize unexpected machine down times. Although cloud computing enables ubiquitous and instant remote access to scalable information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures and high volume data storage, it has limitations in latency-sensitive applications such as high performance computing and real-time stream analytics. The emergence of fog computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and cyber-physical systems (CPS) represent radical changes in the way sensing systems, along with ICT infrastructures, collect and analyze large volumes of real-time data streams in geographically distributed environments. Ultimately, such technological approaches enable machines to function as an agent that is capable of intelligent behaviors such as automatic fault and failure detection, self-diagnosis, and preventative maintenance scheduling. The objective of this research is to introduce a fogenabled architecture that consists of smart sensor networks, communication protocols, parallel machine learning software, and private and public clouds. The fog-enabled architecture will have the potential to enable large-scale, geographically distributed online machine and process monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis that require low latency and high bandwidth in the context of data-driven cyber-manufacturing systems.

@article{Sajid20161375,
	Abstract = {Industrial systems always prefer to reduce their operational expenses. To support such reductions, they need solutions that are capable of providing stability, fault tolerance, and flexibility. One such solution for industrial systems is cyber physical system (CPS) integration with the Internet of Things (IoT) utilizing cloud computing services. These CPSs can be considered as smart industrial systems, with their most prevalent applications in smart transportation, smart grids, smart medical and eHealthcare systems, and many more. These industrial CPSs mostly utilize supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems to control and monitor their critical infrastructure (CI). For example, WebSCADA is an application used for smart medical technologies, making improved patient monitoring and more timely decisions possible. The focus of the study presented in this paper is to highlight the security challenges that the industrial SCADA systems face in an IoT-cloud environment. Classical SCADA systems are already lacking in proper security measures; however, with the integration of complex new architectures for the future Internet based on the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, mobile wireless sensor networks, and so on, there are large issues at stakes in the security and deployment of these classical systems. Therefore, the integration of these future Internet concepts needs more research effort. This paper, along with highlighting the security challenges of these CI's, also provides the existing best practices and recommendations for improving and maintaining security. Finally, this paper briefly describes future research directions to secure these critical CPSs and help the research community in identifying the research gaps in this regard. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Cloud computing is becoming more and more an essential component in the cyberspace system. In this context, Cloud providers offer a multitude of resources and services that constitute a heterogeneous ecosystem and a new economic model. However, several issues remain to be addressed so that the Cloud becomes an efficient part of the cyber-physical system. In this paper, we propose to address a platform as-a-service (PaaS) drawback that we noted as part of our work on service-based applications deployment in Cloud platforms. To deal with that, we propose a new approach that we called SPD approach to provision appropriate platform resources and ensure hosting and deployment of applications based on Service Component Architecture or business process orchestration (Business Process Execution Language) specifications in Cloud platforms. The SPD approach stands for the three main steps of the process that we have defined, that is, (1) slice the application deployables into a set of elementary services, (2) package them into our already developed service micro-containers, and then (3) deploy the obtained service micro-containers in a target PaaS provider. Our approach is a PaaS-independent approach that allows developers to deploy service-based applications on any PaaS regardless of its capabilities. To illustrate our approach and to experiment its performances, we provide two realistic use cases scenarios, that is, a Service Component Architecture-based application and a Business Process Execution Language-based process deployment in Cloud Foundry PaaS. {\copyright} 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {In the last decade the industrial automation had been making important changes integrating Internet and other emergent technologies, concepts, methods and tools, as cloud computing and Service Oriented Architecture(SOA) approaches. As a first consequence, the industrial automation context is also increasing in complexity, presenting new challenges for engineers and managers. Examples include dealing with autonomous cyber physical systems, evolvable heterogeneous structures that do not appear completely formed and where functions and goal are added, removed or modified along the life cycle, as well as handling emergent properties and behaviours of entire systems, e.g. resulting from integrating new systems being not localized to any single system component. [1]. The objective of this paper is to make a review in industrial automation background, analyze the technological trends and challenges and propose a flexible and autoconfigurable service-oriented model, making up basis for the cloud manufacturing. In this model the entities are loosely coupled, due the fact that a service's functionality communication is showed through its interfaces. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

	Abstract = {The main vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) is to equip real-life physical objects with computing and communication power so that they can interact with each other for the social good. As one of the key members of IoT, Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has seen steep advancement in communication technologies. Now, vehicles can easily exchange safety, efficiency, infotainment, and comfort-related information with other vehicles and infrastructures using vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). We leverage on the cloud-based VANETs theme to propose cyber-physical architecture for the Social IoV (SIoV). SIoV is a vehicular instance of the Social IoT (SIoT), where vehicles are the key social entities in the machine-to-machine vehicular social networks. We have identified the social structures of SIoV components, their relationships, and the interaction types. We have mapped VANETs components into IoT-A architecture reference model to offer better integration of SIoV with other IoT domains. We also present a communication message structure based on automotive ontologies, the SAE J2735 message set, and the advanced traveler information system events schema that corresponds to the social graph. Finally, we provide the implementation details and the experimental analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system as well as include different application scenarios for various user groups. {\copyright} 2015 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Cyber Physical Systems: Architectures, Protocols and Applications helps you understand the basic principles and key supporting standards of CPS. It analyzes different CPS applications from the bottom up, extracting the common characters that form a vertical structure. It presents mobile sensing platforms and their applications toward interrelated paradigms, highlighting and briefly discussing different types of mobile sensing platforms and the functionalities they offer. It then looks at the naming, addressing, and profile services of CPS and proposes a middleware component to meet the requirements of dynamic applications and sensors/actuators deployment/configurations across different platforms. The middle chapters of the book present a context-aware sensor search, selection, and ranking model which addresses the challenge of efficiently selecting a subset of relevant sensors out of a large set of sensors with similar functionality and capabilities. The authors consider various topics in the energy management of CPS and propose a novel energy-efficient framework. They also present the fundamental networking technologies of CPS and focus on machine-to-machine communications for CPS, specifically the open technologies such as IPv6-based solutions that can be integrated into IoT and enable wireless sensor communications. In the book's final chapters, the authors bring you up to date on mobile cloud computing (MCC) research activities that enhance the capabilities of resource-constrained smart devices in CPS sensory environments. They also present a few representative CPS applications, including connected healthcare, gaming in public transport crowds, and a series of MCC-enabled emerging CPS applications. You will find that these application fields fully demonstrate the great potential of applying CPS in public life. {\copyright} 2016 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	Abstract = {This chapter describes a unified framework for dynamically integrating and meaningfully organizing personal and social Big Data. With the rapid development of emerging computing paradigms, we have been continuously experiencing a change in work, life, playing, and learning in the highly developed information society, which is a kind of seamless integration of the real physical world and cyber digital space. More and more people have been accustomed to sharing their personal contents across the social networks due to the high accessibility of social media along with the increasingly widespread adoption of wireless mobile computing devices. User-generated information has spread more widely and quickly and provided people with opportunities to obtain more knowledge and information than ever before, which leads to an explosive increase of data scale, containing big potential value for individual, business, domestic, and national economy development. Thus, it has become an increasingly important issue to sustainably manage and utilize personal Big Data, in order to mine useful insight and real value to better support information seeking and knowledge discovery. To deal with this situation in the Big Data era, a unified approach to aggregation and integration of personal Big Data from life logs in accordance with individual needs is considered essential and effective, which can benefit the sustainable information sharing and utilization process in the social networking environment. In this chapter, a new concept of organic stream, which is designed as a flexibly extensible data carrier, is introduced and defined to provide a simple but efficient means to formulate, organize, and represent personal Big Data. As an abstract data type, organic streams can be regarded as a logic metaphor, which aims to meaningfully process the raw stream data into an associatively and methodically organized form, but no concrete implementation for physical data structure and stor-age is defined. Under the conceptual model of organic streams, a heuristic method is proposed and applied to extract diversified individual needs from the tremendous amount of social stream data through social media. And an integrated mechanism is developed to aggregate and integrate the relevant data together based on individual needs in a meaningful way, in which personal data can be physically stored and distributed in private personal clouds and logically represented and processed by a set of newly introduced metaphors named heuristic stone, associative drop, and associative ripple the architecture of the system with the foundational modules is described, and the prototype implementation with the experiment's result is presented to demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of the framework and system. {\copyright} 2015 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	Abstract = {An emerging hyper-world encompasses all human activities in a social-cyber-physical space. Its power derives from the Wisdom Web of Things (W2T) cycle, namely, 'from things to data, information, knowledge, wisdom, services, humans, and then back to things.'' The W2T cycle leads to a harmonious symbiosis among humans, computers, and things, which can be constructed by large-scale converging of intelligent information technology applications with an open and interoperable architecture. The recent advances in cloud computing, the Internet of Things, Web of Things, Big Data, and other research fields have provided just such an open system architecture with resource sharing and services. The next step is to develop an open and interoperable content architecture with intelligent sharing and services for the organization and transformation in the data, information, knowledge, and wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy. This article introduces wisdom as a service (WaaS), a content architecture based on the pay-as-you-go IT trend. The WaaS infrastructure and the main challenges in WaaS research and applications are discussed. A case study is also described. Relying on cloud computing and big data, WaaS provides a practical approach to realize the W2T cycle in the hyper-world for the coming age of ubiquitous intelligent IT applications. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {The book aims to provide a broad overview of various topics of Internet of Things from the research, innovation and development priorities to enabling technologies, nanoelectronics, cyber physical systems, architecture, interoperability and industrial applications. It is intended to be a standalone book in a series that covers the Internet of Things activities of the IERC - Internet of Things European Research Cluster from technology to international cooperation and the global "state of play". The book builds on the ideas put forward by the European research Cluster on the Internet of Things Strategic Research Agenda and presents global views and state of the art results on the challenges facing the research, development and deployment of IoT at the global level. Internet of Things is creating a revolutionary new paradigm, with opportunities in every industry from Health Care, Pharmaceuticals, Food and Beverage, Agriculture, Computer, Electronics Telecommunications, Automotive, Aeronautics, Transportation Energy and Retail to apply the massive potential of the IoT to achieving real-world solutions. The beneficiaries will include as well semiconductor companies, device and product companies, infrastructure software companies, application software companies, consulting companies, telecommunication and cloud service providers. IoT will create new revenues annually for these stakeholders, and potentially create substantial market share shakeups due to increased technology competition. The IoT will fuel technology innovation by creating the means for machines to communicate many different types of information with one another while contributing in the increased value of information created by the number of interconnections among things and the transformation of the processed information into knowledge shared into the Internet of Everything. The success of IoT depends strongly on enabling technology development, market acceptance and standardization, which provides interoperability, compatibility, reliability, and effective operations on a global scale. The connected devices are part of ecosystems connecting people, processes, data, and things which are communicating in the cloud using the increased storage and computing power and pushing for standardization of communication and metadata. In this context security, privacy, safety, trust have to be address by the product manufacturers through the life cycle of their products from design to the support processes. The IoT developments address the whole IoT spectrum - from devices at the edge to cloud and datacentres on the backend and everything in between, through ecosystems are created by industry, research and application stakeholders that enable real-world use cases to accelerate the Internet of Things and establish open interoperability standards and common architectures for IoT solutions. Enabling technologies such as nanoelectronics, sensors/actuators, cyber-physical systems, intelligent device management, smart gateways, telematics, smart network infrastructure, cloud computing and software technologies will create new products, new services, new interfaces by creating smart environments and smart spaces with applications ranging from Smart Cities, smart transport, buildings, energy, grid, to smart health and life. {\copyright} 2014 River Publishers.

	Abstract = {Contemporary wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have evolved into large and complex systems and are one of the main technologies used in cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things. Extensive research on WSNs has led to the development of diverse solutions at all levels of software architecture, including protocol stacks for communications. This multitude of solutions is due to the limited computational power and restrictions on energy consumption that must be accounted for when designing typical WSN systems. It is therefore challenging to develop, test and validate even small WSN applications, and this process can easily consume significant resources. Simulations are inexpensive tools for testing, verifying and generally experimenting with new technologies in a repeatable fashion. Consequently, as the size of the systems to be tested increases, so does the need for large-scale simulations. This article describes a tool called Maestro for the automation of large-scale simulation and investigates the feasibility of using cloud computing facilities for such task. Using tools that are built into Maestro, we demonstrate a feasible approach for benchmarking cloud infrastructure in order to identify cloud Virtual Machine (VM)instances that provide an optimal balance of performance and cost for a given simulation. {\copyright} 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

In this paper, we propose the integration of two complementary mainstream paradigms for large-scale distributed computing: Agents and Cloud. Agent-based computing can support the development of decentralized, dynamic, cooperating and open IoT systems in terms of multi-agent systems. Cloud computing can enhance the IoT objects with high performance computing capabilities and huge storage resources. In particular, we introduce a cloud-assisted and agent-oriented IoT architecture that will be realized through ACOSO, an agent-oriented middleware for cooperating smart objects, and BodyCloud, a sensor-cloud infrastructure for large-scale sensor-based systems. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {Cyber-physical systems increasingly rely on distributed computing platforms where sensing, computing, actuation, and communication resources are shared by a multitude of applications. Such 'cyber-physical cloud computing platforms' present novel challenges because the system is built from mobile embedded devices, is inherently distributed, and typically suffers from highly fluctuating connectivity among the modules. Architecting software for these systems raises many challenges not present in traditional cloud computing. Effective management of constrained resources and application isolation without adversely affecting performance are necessary. Autonomous fault management and real-time performance requirements must be met in a verifiable manner. It is also both critical and challenging to support multiple end-users whose diverse software applications have changing demands for computational and communication resources, while operating on different levels and in separate domains of security. The solution presented in this paper is based on a layered architecture consisting of a novel operating system, a middleware layer, and component-structured applications. The component model facilitates the construction of software applications from modular and reusable components that are deployed in the distributed system and interact only through well-defined mechanisms. The complexity of creating applications and performing system integration is mitigated through the use of a domain-specific model-driven development process that relies on a domain-specific modeling language and its accompanying graphical modeling tools, software generators for synthesizing infrastructure code, and the extensive use of model-based analysis for verification and validation. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

An annular collaborative management mechanism is put forward for the flexible dispatch and management of the massive information resources under the "plug and play" control of microgrid, which effectively enhances the working stability of physical device nodes and reduces the computing load of upper nodes.

	Abstract = {With the ongoing trend to parallelize computations for scalability, better performance, and reliability, distributed dataflow models are attracting interest at all design levels, ranging from processor architectures to local- and wide-area computing clusters in the cloud. Data-driven computation has also been an important paradigm in sensor networks and embedded systems, which have evolved into a larger research effort on networked cyber-physical systems (NCPS), that can sense and affect their environment. Fractionated cyber-physical systems (FCPS) are an interesting subclass of NCPS where the redundancy and diversity of many unreliable and potentially heterogeneous networked components is exploited to improve scalability, reliability, and verifiability of the overall system. In this paper we present the theory of a new distributed computing model for such systems as a first step toward a modelbased design methodology for FCPS. To uniformly capture dataflow, controlflow, and workflow, we use a subclass of Petri nets as an intuitive high-level model, which is translated into a weaker model --- namely, a new variant of Petri nets that does not make any atomicity assumptions but instead uses a partial order to ensure eventual consistency. In the full version of this paper, we briefly discuss an application to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms, which has been implemented on top of a prototype of our theory for both simulation models and real world deployments. {\copyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

	Abstract = {Last decade saw the development of Wireless Sensor Networks with multitude of applications built around the sensors. Though most of the issues at protocol and device level remain solved for Wireless Sensor Networks, there is a growing trend in integration of sensors and sensor based systems with Cyber Physical Systems, Machine-to-Machine and Device-to-Device communication both in infrastructure and ad-hoc modes. The emergence of Cloud Computing, highly intelligent 'Smart' devices and efforts towards 5th Generation telecom systems is expected to lead the revolution of a networked world with increased demand for situational awareness leading proliferation of sensors at the edge of physical world. Mounting intelligence built in 'smart' devices, scarcity of frequency spectrum, disruptive technologies and limitations on further reduction in base station size may render base station centric-architecture of today's wireless networks old-fashioned. Due to low data rate bursty nature of sensor data, massive-MIMO antennas, device-centric architectures, smarter devices and native support for Machine-to-Machine and Device-to-Device communication, sensor data originating from these systems and disruptive technologies is expected to grow manifold through passing years. Communication and network engineers face an emerging challenge of designing communication and network protocols that can efficiently get integrated with the emerging wireless cellular and computing paradigms. In this paper, we list down these communication and networking challenges and provide our vision for Wireless Sensor Networks related platforms and enabling technologies of next decade. {\copyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

	Abstract = {This book presents a range of cloud computing security challenges and promising solution paths. The first two chapters focus on practical considerations of cloud computing. In Chapter 1, Chandramouli, Iorga, and Chokani describe the evolution of cloud computing and the current state of practice, followed by the challenges of cryptographic key management in the cloud. In Chapter 2, Chen and Sion present a dollar cost model of cloud computing and explore the economic viability of cloud computing with and without security mechanisms involving cryptographic mechanisms. The next two chapters address security issues of the cloud infrastructure. In Chapter 3, Szefer and Lee describe a hardware-enhanced security architecture that protects the confidentiality and integrity of a virtual machine's memory from an untrusted or malicious hypervisor. In Chapter 4, Tsugawa et al. discuss the security issues introduced when Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is deployed within and across clouds. Chapters 5-9 focus on the protection of data stored in the cloud. In Chapter 5, Wang et al. present two storage isolation schemes that enable cloud users with high security requirements to verify that their disk storage is isolated from some or all other users, without any cooperation from cloud service providers. In Chapter 6, De Capitani di Vimercati, Foresti, and Samarati describe emerging approaches for protecting data stored externally and for enforcing fine-grained and selective accesses on them, and illustrate how the combination of these approaches can introduce new privacy risks. In Chapter 7, Le, Kant, and Jajodia explore data access challenges in collaborative enterprise computing environments where multiple parties formulate their own authorization rules, and discuss the problems of rule consistency, enforcement, and dynamic updates. In Chapter 8, Smith et al. address key challenges to the practical realization of a system that supports query execution over remote encrypted data without exposing decryption keys or plaintext at the server. In Chapter 9, Sun et al. provide an overview of secure search techniques over encrypted data, and then elaborate on a scheme that can achieve privacy-preserving multi-keyword text search. The next three chapters focus on the secure deployment of computations to the cloud. In Chapter 10, Oktay el al. present a risk-based approach for workload partitioning in hybrid clouds that selectively outsources data and computation based on their level of sensitivity. The chapter also describes a vulnerability assessment framework for cloud computing environments. In Chapter 11, Albanese et al. present a solution for deploying a mission in the cloud while minimizing the mission's exposure to known vulnerabilities, and a cost-effective approach to harden the computational resources selected to support the mission. In Chapter 12, Kontaxis et al. describe a system that generates computational decoys to introduce uncertainty and deceive adversaries as to which data and computation is legitimate. The last section of the book addresses issues related to security monitoring and system resilience. In Chapter 13, Zhou presents a secure, provenance-based capability that captures dependencies between system states, tracks state changes over time, and that answers attribution questions about the existence, or change, of a system's state at a given time. In Chapter 14, Wu et al. present a monitoring capability for multicore architectures that runs monitoring threads concurrently with user or kernel code to constantly check for security violations. Finally, in Chapter 15, Hasan Cam describes how to manage the risk and resilience of cyber-physical systems by employing controllability and observability techniques for linear and non-linear systems. {\copyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

	Abstract = {Tubiquitous ultra-broadband network enabling the future Internet (FI), is not only about new releases of current network generations and services, but, more significantly, will be associated with a true revolution in the information and communications technologies (ICT) field: the network will efficiently and effectively take forward new-fangled services to everyone and everything, such as cognitive objects and cyber physical systems (CPSs). A "full immersive (3D) experience" enriched by "context information" and, in particular, "anything or everything as a service (XaaS)" are the main business drivers for massive adoption and market uptake of the new fundamental enabling technologies, beyond today's "client-server" model, where the network has been reduced to a ubiquitous "pipe of bits." XaaS refers to those services - beyond the current models of software as a service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and platfore as a service (PaaS), SPI models, of cloud computing - such as data as a service (DaaS), security as a service (again, SaaS), network as a service (NaaS), knowledge as a service (KaaS), machine as a service (MaaS), and robot as a service (RaaS), which could be delivered over the advanced 5G infrastructure, without the need to own hardware, software, or even the cognitive objects themselves. Communication services, such as voice and video telephony, will be enriched and bundled with other services. The network infrastructure is expected to become the "nervous system" of the actual digital society and digital economy. This challenge calls for a complete redesign of services and service capabilities, architectures, interfaces, functions, access and non-access stratum protocols and related procedures, as well as advanced algorithms (e.g., for unified connection, security, mobility and routing management, and reconfiguration of ICT services; and any type of resource of cyber physical systems). The expected transformation will be especially true at the edge, that is, around the end user (or prosumer), where the "intelligence" already started migrating a few years ago, and where massive processing, memory, and storage capacity are gradually accumulating. {\copyright} 2014, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

	Abstract = {The limited awareness abilities, simple service modes and long delays of updating dynamic information of most existing traffic information service systems were analyzed. A novel framework of ubiquitous traffic information service system (U-TISS) was proposed based on the current TISSs, and the research and development tendencies of traffic engineering and information science. U-TISS integrated advanced cooperative sensing, ubiquitous network, cloud computation and big data to realize the deep fusion between TISSs and traffic cyber physical systems. The architecture of U-TISS mainly consisted of four layers, including sensing, network, computation and service. In sensing layer, a comprehensive sensing on pedestrians, vehicles, roads and environments were carried out by sensors, RFIDs, readers, cameras, GPS, vehicle intelligent terminals, etc. In network layer, peripheral communication and carrying network communication were implemented, such as ZigBee, bluetooth, DSRC, 3G/4G, and wired link, and an accurate capture and release system was built to timely collect and transmit traffic information by short-range communication between roads and cars, self-organizing network, and carrying network between roadsides and monitor centers. In computation layer, cloud computation extracted traffic information effectively to enhance the service quality of traffic information. In service layer, a service platform was constructed based on ubiquitous network and cloud computation. Its information was released timely by mobile intelligent terminals, vehicular terminals, information broadcasts and variable signal boards, and the auxiliary decision support was provided to realize the intelligentization and individuation of information service. The key technologies of U-TISS implementation were analyzed, including pervasive sensing and interaction of smart devices, accurate measurement of vehicle position and orientation, cooperative sensing of traffic information with road side units, communication and networking of vehicle-to-vehicle/vehicle-to-infrastructure, on-board mobile internet, traffic information management in the cloud, analysis and excavation of traffic big data, and information security and privacy protection. Analysis result shows that the characteristics of U-TISS are ubiquitous sensing, open interconnection, real-time transmission, deep mining and high quality service, and can improve the service level of TISS in safety, high efficiency, convenience and environmental protection. In term of safety, wireless communication and networking technology provide drivers with multi-scale tempo-spatial traffic information beyond the line of sight and the sensing capability of vehicles. In term of high efficiency, ubiquitous sensing of massive traffic information and big data analysis based on cloud computing techniques can achieve the efficient operation of transportation systems with refinement of management. In term of convenience, the public can get personalized and customized travel information through smart devices. In term of environmental protection, vehicle control systems can be optimized by the information of driving environment, and the awareness of eco-driving behaviors can be raised by big data and social network, so that green travel is realized. With the breakthrough of key technologies and the issuing of related standards and norms, the innovation and change of business mode will occur in the field of traffic information service, which will lead to collaborative intelligent transportation.},

This paper presents Vita, a novel mobile cyber-physical system for crowdsensing applications, which enables mobile users to perform mobile crowdsensing tasks in an efficient manner through mobile devices. Vita provides a flexible and universal architecture across mobile devices and cloud computing platforms by integrating the service-oriented architecture with resource optimization mechanism for crowdsensing, with extensive supports to application developers and end users. The customized platform of Vita enables intelligent deployments of tasks between humans in the physical world, and dynamic collaborations of services between mobile devices and cloud computing platform during run-time of mobile devices with service failure handling support. Our practical experiments show that Vita performs its tasks efficiently with a low computation and communication overhead on mobile devices, and eases the development of multiple mobile crowdsensing applications and services.

	Abstract = {Cloud computing-based data centers, which hold a large amount of customer data, are vulnerable to physical attacks and insider threats. Current protection and defense mechanisms for security of data held in data centers are either completely physical (sensors, barriers, etc.) or completely cyber (firewalls, encryption, etc.). In this paper we propose a novel cyber-physical security defense for cloud computing-based data centers against physical attacks. In our system, physical sensors detect an impending physical/human attack which triggers cyber defenses to protect or mitigate the attack. The key to the cyber defenses is that in cloud computing data centers the data is loosely coupled with the underlying physical hardware, and can be moved/migrated to other physical hardware in the presence of an attack. In this paper we propose a model for coupling such cyber defenses with physical attack-detection sensors. We further describe a preliminary architecture for building such a system with today's cloud computing infrastructure. {\copyright} 2012 IEEE.},

The proposed CPeSC 3 architecture is composed of three main components, namely 1) communication core, 2) computation core, and 3) resource scheduling and management core. Detailed analysis and explanations are given for relevant models such as cloud computing, real time scheduling and security models.

	Abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are convergence of real physical world and computation world. CPS systems are rapidly becoming an important development strategies with broad application domains. The key requirements for CPS systems are to support multiple applications with many different resources at the same time in timeliness and also ensure energy efficiency. This paper presents the Cyber-Physical integrated cloud computing system called Cyber-Physical Cloud (CPC) to solve these key requirements. CPC architecture is designed for various applications such as health care, smart cars, traffic control, etc where multiple wireless sensor networks (WSNs) communicate with each other through mobile ad hoc network. Concurrently, CPC architecture can leverage cloud computing to process effectively computation and resource management by virtualization technique. Moreover, CPS systems are built on heterogeneous WSNs to collect and process the physical objects by obtaining data and thereafter processing queries. As a part of CPS systems, the key requirement for WSNs is to sustain a long lifetime because of limited power supplies. We work on real time preemptive query scheduling in WSNs with a focus on quality of data (QoD) to analysis useful energy consumption and interference energy consumption.We propose the Energy efficiency Aware Quality of Data (EAQD) method that runs on real time preemptive query scheduling to find the expected QoD for each query thus enabling energy consumption minimization. EAQD method also computes the transmitting/receiving slots needed for each query to avoid wasting slots. The simulation results show the our approach can reduce energy consumption up to 5 times as compares to previous approaches. {\copyright} 2011 IEEE.},

	Abstract = {The widespread use of smart phone devices and their ubiquity has brought up new application domains. One such interesting domain is vehicular networks. Furthermore, cloud computing is a next-generation information and communication technology that is gaining popularity due to its pay-as-you-go service model. In this paper, we propose our novel V-Cloud architecture which includes vehicular cyber-physical system (VCPS), vehicle-to-vehicle network (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure network (V2I) layers. Each of these layers is explained in further details. We discuss research challenges in V-Cloud domain and introduce new services to show wide potential of such intelligent transportation system to meet safety and comfort requirements for driver. {\copyright} 2011 ACM.},

	Abstract = {A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is defined as integrations of computation and physical processes. In CPS, downsized embedded devices monitor and manage the physical process. Mobile Internet Device (MID), as a portable handheld device designed for mobility providing a down-graded computing capability, can be used as a strong candidate for client-side devices in CPS. Since these physical devices have limited resources, it is not possible to execute complex computation and processes. To cope with this challenge, we apply Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) or Cloud Computing (CC) concepts to CPS, called a service-based CPS. To realize a service-based CPS, we first define overall architecture with three tiers. And, we present key methods to design each tier in the architecture. The design methods are defined to deal with design challenges of CPSs such as dynamic composition, dynamic adaptation, and high confidence CPS management. Then, we perform a case study to show applicability of our approach. With this approach, we hope that CPS can even handle complex and resource-consuming physical processes with a downsized MID. {\copyright} 2010 IEEE.},
