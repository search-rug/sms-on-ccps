abstract = {Summary Cloud computing is becoming more and more an essential component in the cyberspace system. In this context, Cloud providers offer a multitude of resources and services that constitute a heterogeneous ecosystem and a new economic model. However, several issues remain to be addressed so that the Cloud becomes an efficient part of the cyber-physical system. In this paper, we propose to address a platform as-a-service (PaaS) drawback that we noted as part of our work on service-based applications deployment in Cloud platforms. To deal with that, we propose a new approach that we called SPD approach to provision appropriate platform resources and ensure hosting and deployment of applications based on Service Component Architecture or business process orchestration (Business Process Execution Language) specifications in Cloud platforms. The SPD approach stands for the three main steps of the process that we have defined, that is, (1) slice the application deployables into a set of elementary services, (2) package them into our already developed service micro-containers, and then (3) deploy the obtained service micro-containers in a target PaaS provider. Our approach is a PaaS-independent approach that allows developers to deploy service-based applications on any PaaS regardless of its capabilities. To illustrate our approach and to experiment its performances, we provide two realistic use cases scenarios, that is, a Service Component Architecture-based application and a Business Process Execution Language-based process deployment in Cloud Foundry PaaS.

abstract = {Abstract The concept of Smart Factory, a new paradigm in manufacturing industry, has emerged and is expanding exponentially. This shift is apparent in new IT such as Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Cloud Computing. Varieties of Smart Factory architecture applying these technologies are already widespread. However, most of the widespread architecture only define manufacturing levels from Level 0 (Physical Processing) to Level 4 (Business Logistics Systems) and specify services that are provided between them. These technical specifications do not guide the development processes and do not provide the architecture to implement Smart Factory infrastructure within existing factory. In this paper, we propose Smart Service System-based Smart Factory (4SF) architecture that can be utilized without major changes to existing systems by using “add-on” concepts of Smart Factory. Furthermore, we applied Systems Engineering process to enable system design based on requirements in manufacturing industry using an operational, system and technology model. Finally, these concepts were applied to a steel plate plant to show practical potential of Smart Service System-based Smart Factory.},

abstract = {Summary The complexity of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) opens up several challenges regarding the assurance of high levels of reliability. Therefore, we need to develop a new data quality analysis and new CPS components/subsystems for the detection, isolation, recovery, and prevention of failures and intrusion events. Furthermore, we have to develop new reliability assessment models and metrics in order to properly evaluate CPSs. Agent technologies, through their characteristics such as autonomy, social ability, reactivity, and proactivity, have the potential to address these challenges and requirements. We propose a multi-agent based solution, namely ReliaCPS, for detecting and preventing the failures of the system components of CPSs. We also use a case study of a CPS for monitoring ambient parameters to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Our results indicate improvements in terms of reliability metrics (32.69\% for the mean time between failures and mean time to failure, 50\% for the mean time to repair and 0.94\% for reliability function over time).},

abstract = {Abstract It is generally known that the trust relationships among mobile nodes of vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) are uncertain in transportation cyber-physical system (T-CPS). However, the existing researches could not accurately describe the uncertainty in their trust evaluation models. To solve this problem, we propose a novel membership cloud-based trust evaluation model for VANET of T-CPS. The proposed model considers the trust uncertainty of fuzziness and randomness in the interactions among vehicles and uses membership cloud to describe the uncertainty in unified formats. Besides, we give the detail description of trustworthiness as well as algorithm to calculate the cloud droplets and the aggregated trust evaluation values. An experiment of study case demonstrates that our trust model can perfectly describe trust relationship among vehicles from the quantitative data to the qualitative information, and also vice versa. Thus, our trust model can accurately describe the uncertainty of fuzziness and randomness of the trust relationships. Meanwhile, two typical scenarios simulation and comparison with other up to date models demonstrate the validity and practicality of our trust model among vehicles for VANET of T-CPS.

abstract = {Summary In cloud robotics where robots are interconnected by local and cloud network, robots interact and cooperate with other remote robots and such robot group activity may involve dynamic registration and deregistration of foreign robots into the group. In such cases, the security and privacy for robotic data and activities become a sensitive issue. Security becomes complex if a cloud robot group involves various robotic roles/attributes as part of their access control policies and if such policies and role/attribute assignment rules are subject to dynamic changes. Most of all, the security breach in cloud robots may lead to irrevocable disasters in the physical world. To this end, we propose a cloud robot community model, which is based on Policy-based Establishment of Ad hoc Communities (PEACE) architecture, extended by attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme. The proposed model allows robots to join a robot community, assigns a set of attributes, and enforces service access control policies by using ABE keys as credentials. The proposed cloud robot community policy is flexible, scalable, and its ABE-based service access control enhances the privacy of the robots in the community.}

abstract = {Summary Agricultural products are an important guarantee for human health. The supply chain of agricultural products as its carrier has always been a research hotspot in academia and business circles. Applying the Internet of Things and NFC technology to the agricultural product supply chain area will play an important role in the intelligent management and traceability of agricultural product supply chains. The intelligent management and traceability of agricultural products supply chain are the management of data information. How to collect, store, process, analyze, and visualize the data information during the flow of agricultural products from the source to the table is an important issue which needs urgent research. This paper proposes and validates the NFC technology assumption of the application value of agricultural product supply chain. The communication interface between the agricultural product supply chain data acquisition terminal and the collection terminal module and peripheral equipment based on BD, GSM, and NFC module is designed. The physical storage structure of the NFC tag is then planned, and the DES and RSA encryption algorithms of the NFC tag are implemented. According to the theory of Internet of Things, the traceability system of agricultural product supply chain is divided into four levels: physical layer, service layer, data layer, and application layer. The three major areas of enterprise management, user query, and government supervision are designed to trace the information flow and system. Finally, this paper analyzes the hardware resources needed for the traceability system of agricultural product supply chain and uses the resources of the cooperative supply chain enterprise to implement the system application and deployment. The experiment verifies that the real-time traceability monitoring system for agricultural product supply chain proposed in this paper is effective in practical application.},

abstract = {Summary In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as one of the hottest trends in information and communication technology (ICT) thanks to the proliferation of field-deployed, dispersed, and heterogeneous sensor- and actuator-hosting platforms. One of the main problems in deploying IoT devices is their secure registration and remote attestation (RA) that is necessary to interconnect them over the Cloud in a secure way. This chapter discusses a reference architecture for secure registration and RA services to join an IoT Cloud provider taking into consideration the aforementioned security capabilities and applying them to an embedded device running Stack4Things (S4T). It also discusses several hardware/software security capabilities that allow an IoT device, such as Arduino YUN, to enforce advanced security mechanisms. The chapter focuses on capabilities such as trusted computing (TC), additional security keys, cryptographic algorithms, and hidden IDs that are useful in developing the security services. It analyzes both board-side and Cloud-side security extensions.}

The Internet of Things (IoT) includes a diverse range of a vast collection of heterogeneous devices that require interoperable communication, scalable platforms, and security provisioning. Security provisioning to an SDN-based IoT network poses a real security challenge leading to various serious security threats due to the connection of various heterogeneous devices having a wide range of access protocols. Furthermore, the logical centralized controlled intelligence of the SDN architecture represents a plethora of security challenges due to its single point of failure. It may throw the entire network into chaos and thus expose it to various known and unknown security threats and attacks. Security of SDN controlled IoT environment is still in infancy and thus remains the prime research agenda for both the industry and academia. This paper comprehensively reviews the current state-of-the-art security threats, vulnerabilities, and issues at the control plane. Moreover, this paper contributes by presenting a detailed classification of various security attacks on the control layer. A comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the latest mitigation techniques for various security breaches is also presented. Finally, this paper presents future research directions and challenges for further investigation down the line.}
